1857. I HAVEN'T HAD FUN IN AGES. I HAVE _________ RIGHT NOW. (NOTE: THIS SENTENCE IS INCOMPLETE OR PHRASED AWKWARDLY FOR THE GIVEN OPTIONS, AS THE OPTIONS DO NOT LOGICALLY COMPLETE "I HAVE... RIGHT NOW" TO MEAN "I'M HAVING FUN." HOWEVER, ASSUMING THE INTENT IS TO SAY 'I HAVE TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE' MEANING I'M BUSY/STRESSED/NOT HAVING FUN, OR IF IT'S MEANT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE 'I NEED TO LET LOOSE RIGHT NOW,' LET'S CHECK THE OPTIONS. NONE FIT PERFECTLY FOR 'FUN', BUT FOR A FILL-IN-THE-BLANK QUESTION, WE RE-EVALUATE THE QUESTION AND OPTIONS. IF THE INTENDED SENTENCE WAS "I HAVEN'T HAD FUN IN AGES. I CAN'T HAVE FUN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I HAVE _________", THEN 'TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE' WOULD FIT. SINCE WE MUST CHOOSE THE *CORRECT* OPTION FROM THE PROVIDED TEXT, AND THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS A STATEMENT OF PAST LACK OF FUN, THE CURRENT SENTENCE IS EXPECTED TO RELATE. OPTION (C) 'TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE' (MEANING TOO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES) CONTRASTS WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING FUN, WHICH MIGHT BE THE INTENDED MEANING FOR A TEST-TAKER'S CHALLENGE, EVEN IF THE FLOW IS SLIGHTLY ODD. IF THE SENTENCE WAS 'I MUST HAVE FUN RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO...', THE OPTIONS STILL DON'T FIT. GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS, SELECTING THE MOST LIKELY INTENDED ANSWER IN AN EXAM CONTEXT THAT OFTEN USES CONTRAST/REASON IS NEEDED. LET'S ASSUME THE QUESTION HAS A TYPO AND SHOULD IMPLY A REASON FOR NOT HAVING FUN, MAKING (C) THE MOST PLAUSIBLE CHOICE.) :

   b) done all in a day's work
   c) too much on my plate

NONE FIT PERFECTLY FOR 'FUN', BUT FOR A FILL-IN-THE-BLANK QUESTION, WE RE-EVALUATE THE QUESTION AND OPTIONS. IF THE INTENDED SENTENCE WAS "I HAVEN'T HAD FUN IN AGES. I CAN'T HAVE FUN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I HAVE _________", THEN 'TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE' WOULD FIT. SINCE WE MUST CHOOSE THE *CORRECT* OPTION FROM THE PROVIDED TEXT, AND THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS A STATEMENT OF PAST LACK OF FUN, THE CURRENT SENTENCE IS EXPECTED TO RELATE. OPTION (C) 'TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE' (MEANING TOO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES) CONTRASTS WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING FUN, WHICH MIGHT BE THE INTENDED MEANING FOR A TEST-TAKER'S CHALLENGE, EVEN IF THE FLOW IS SLIGHTLY ODD. IF THE SENTENCE WAS 'I MUST HAVE FUN RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO...', THE OPTIONS STILL DON'T FIT. GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS, SELECTING THE MOST LIKELY INTENDED ANSWER IN AN EXAM CONTEXT THAT OFTEN USES CONTRAST/REASON IS NEEDED. LET'S ASSUME THE QUESTION HAS A TYPO AND SHOULD IMPLY A REASON FOR NOT HAVING FUN, MAKING (C) THE MOST PLAUSIBLE CHOICE.) :

6991. I HAVEN'T HAD FUN IN AGES. I HAVE _________ RIGHT NOW. (NOTE: THIS SENTENCE IS INCOMPLETE OR PHRASED AWKWARDLY FOR THE GIVEN OPTIONS, AS THE OPTIONS DO NOT LOGICALLY COMPLETE "I HAVE... RIGHT NOW" TO MEAN "I'M HAVING FUN." HOWEVER, ASSUMING THE INTENT IS TO SAY 'I HAVE TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE' MEANING I'M BUSY/STRESSED/NOT HAVING FUN, OR IF IT'S MEANT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE 'I NEED TO LET LOOSE RIGHT NOW,' LET'S CHECK THE OPTIONS. NONE FIT PERFECTLY FOR 'FUN', BUT FOR A FILL-IN-THE-BLANK QUESTION, WE RE-EVALUATE THE QUESTION AND OPTIONS. IF THE INTENDED SENTENCE WAS "I HAVEN'T HAD FUN IN AGES. I CAN'T HAVE FUN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I HAVE _________", THEN 'TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE' WOULD FIT. SINCE WE MUST CHOOSE THE *CORRECT* OPTION FROM THE PROVIDED TEXT, AND THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS A STATEMENT OF PAST LACK OF FUN, THE CURRENT SENTENCE IS EXPECTED TO RELATE. OPTION (C) 'TOO MUCH ON MY PLATE' (MEANING TOO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES) CONTRASTS WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING FUN, WHICH MIGHT BE THE INTENDED MEANING FOR A TEST-TAKER'S CHALLENGE, EVEN IF THE FLOW IS SLIGHTLY ODD. IF THE SENTENCE WAS 'I MUST HAVE FUN RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO...', THE OPTIONS STILL DON'T FIT. GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS, SELECTING THE MOST LIKELY INTENDED ANSWER IN AN EXAM CONTEXT THAT OFTEN USES CONTRAST/REASON IS NEEDED. LET'S ASSUME THE QUESTION HAS A TYPO AND SHOULD IMPLY A REASON FOR NOT HAVING FUN, MAKING (C) THE MOST PLAUSIBLE CHOICE.) :

   b) done all in a day's work
   c) too much on my plate
