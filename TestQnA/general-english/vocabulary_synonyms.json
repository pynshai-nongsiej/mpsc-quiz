'Neglect' is the closest negative action among options if 'destroy' isn't present, or it could imply the result of neglect). Correction: Standard synonym is \"destroy\" or \"ruin\". Among options: to escape, to neglect, to inflict, to ignore. None are perfect synonyms. However, \"wreck\" can mean \"to cause the ruin of\". If options are poor, \"to inflict\" (damage) is possible, but \"to neglect\" (cause ruin by lack of care) is also weak. Let's assume 'Fragile' for Brittle was the clear one. For Wreck, perhaps context implies \"to ruin\". Given options, none is a direct synonym. Self-correction: In some contexts, \"wreck\" is associated with \"ruin\"."

'Discretion' is closer to the root 'arbiter', but in common usage, it implies a decision made without rule. 'Decision' is the noun form related to arbitrate. Actually, Arbitrary means based on random choice or personal whim. 'Discretion' implies choice. Let's look at options. A) Discretion B) Determination C) Distinction D) Decision. None are perfect synonyms. However, an arbitrary act is an act of discretion or decision not based on law. Given the options, 'Discretion' or 'Decision' are the only semantic links. Let's assume 'Discretion' as 'at one's discretion'. Or maybe 'Decision' as in an arbitrary decision. Let's check standard answer keys for similar exams. Often 'Random' or 'Capricious' is the answer. Here, 'Decision' might be the intended loose synonym for an arbitrary act.)"
