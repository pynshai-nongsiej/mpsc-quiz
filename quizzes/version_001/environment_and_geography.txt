Here are 5 MCQs about climate change, mirrors, rivers, and lines:

1.  Which climate change mitigation strategy involves the deployment of large-scale reflective surfaces, acting like "mirrors," to increase the Earth's albedo and reflect sunlight back into space?
    a) Carbon capture and storage (CCS)
    b) Afforestation and reforestation projects
    c) Solar Radiation Management (SRM) geoengineering
    d) River diversion for hydroelectric power
    Answer: c)

2.  The "lines" depicting the historical course of a major river on a map are increasingly being redrawn by scientists due to the effects of climate change. Which of the following is the most significant reason for these changes?
    a) Decreased sediment load leading to clearer water, making the river invisible.
    b) Human-made dams and irrigation canals redirecting flow, unrelated to climate.
    c) Increased frequency and intensity of floods and droughts altering riverbeds and flow patterns.
    d) Reflection of sunlight off the water surface creating optical illusions of altered courses.
    Answer: c)

3.  When studying climate change, scientists often plot data over time, creating "lines" on graphs that visually represent trends. If a graph shows a steady upward "line" of global average temperature, what concept does this line effectively "mirror" or represent?
    a) Ocean acidification
    b) Stratospheric ozone depletion
    c) Global warming
    d) River delta formation rates
    Answer: c)

4.  Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants use extensive arrays of parabolic "mirrors" to focus sunlight, generating clean electricity that helps mitigate climate change. However, a potential environmental concern for these plants, particularly near river systems in arid regions, is their significant demand for:
    a) Land area, leading to deforestation along riverbanks.
    b) Rare earth minerals for mirror coatings, impacting river mining.
    c) Water for cooling and mirror cleaning, potentially depleting local river flows.
    d) Labor, causing demographic shifts in nearby river communities.
    Answer: c)

5.  Climate change-induced sea-level rise causes saltwater intrusion into freshwater river systems, particularly in delta regions. On a hydrological map, how would this phenomenon cause the "line" representing the freshwater-saltwater interface in a river to shift?
    a) The line would move further downstream towards the ocean.
    b) The line would become permanently fixed at the river mouth.
    c) The line would move further upstream into the freshwater zone.
    d) The line would disappear entirely due to complete mixing.
    Answer: c)
