The traveler arrived beneath the great crystalline archway the air suddenly still and heavy a deep silence unlike anything known before permeated the vast expanse structures of pure solidified light rose impossibly high their surfaces pulsed with an inner luminescence casting long flowing shadows across the empty expanse the city appeared sculpted from starlight bound into geometric perfection towers reached toward a sky empty of sun or moon their spires dissolving into a soft ambient glow the travelers own footsteps sounded shockingly loud upon the smooth dark pathways each isolated sound a stark testament to the profound quiet the traveler felt utterly alone adrift in a world crafted by beings long departed a place preserved outside the relentless march of time itself intricate patterns shifted slowly across the towering walls their designs ethereal and complex suggesting an unknown purpose or a sleeping intelligence the gentle breeze offered no scent no whisper merely a cool subtle pressure against the skin the traveler reached a hand toward a nearby column its surface cool smooth like polished ice it resonated with a faint deep hum beneath the touch a subtle energy that seemed alive within the very stone a mixture of profound awe and creeping loneliness filled the traveler this majestic place was breathtakingly beautiful yet profoundly empty a silent monument to creators who had vanished leaving behind only this gleaming echo a spectacular testament to their power and their absence the traveler moved onward deeper into the heart of the silent city the sound of their own breathing seemed unnaturally loud in the immense stillness searching for any sign any indication of another soul any hint of lingering life but finding only the cold unchanging majesty of the light forged architecture and the overwhelming presence of a forgotten history the traveler pondered the immense scale the sheer alien grandeur dwarfing all known measures of existence a tiny speck against the backdrop of eternal silent splendor questioning if this place held a fate similar for all visitors eventually fading absorbed into the pervasive luminescence leaving no memory no trace only the enduring quiet grandeur of the city built from dreams and then abandoned to its endless solitary existence
