Kaelen traversed the luminescent caverns of sector 7G beneath the twin moons of planet Gylos Prime the air thick with a sweet ozone aroma and the faint hum of unseen energy conduits pulsed rhythmically a constant vibration felt through the soles of his bio-integrated boots numbers 3 and 4 on his environmental suit registered stable atmospheric pressure though oxygen levels remained below 18 percent requiring constant filtration from his internal 0 point 9 liter reserve tank crystal formations jutted from every surface reflecting the light of his helmet lamp in a dazzling array of 1000s of fragmented spectra blues greens yellows predominantly but also flashes of violet 7 and an eerie crimson 2 these weren't ordinary crystals they pulsed with a slow internal light like captured stars emitting low frequency waves that interfered slightly with his comms system linking him back to the orbiting research vessel Odyssey at a distance of 30000 kilometers his mission objective was simple map the cavern system and retrieve geological samples specifically crystalline matrix type 4B which preliminary scans indicated possessed unique energy storage capabilities his gloved hand brushed against a massive pillar easily 50 meters high its surface smooth like polished glass but unnervingly warm a thermal reading displayed 38 degrees Celsius significantly above the ambient cave temperature of 10 degrees his scanner detected faint energy signatures emanating from deeper within the complex perhaps a geothermal source or something far more advanced the readings fluctuated wildly from 200 to 750 watts per square meter suggesting unstable power output he pressed onward his boots crunching softly on the crystalline dust a sound amplified tenfold in the echoing silence encountering strange fungal growths resembling giant glowing mushrooms 15 in number clustered around a central spire that reached towards the unseen ceiling their bioluminescence shifted from a soft green 1 to a vibrant blue 9 creating shifting patterns on the cave walls he checked his chronometer another 45 minutes before the scheduled return window opened plenty of time to investigate the source of those anomalous energy readings before heading back to the Odyssey docking bay 12
