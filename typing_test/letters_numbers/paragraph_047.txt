Their optical sensors 2020 detect faint energy signatures 4040 The sky above is a perpetual twilight a haze 30 percent denser than normal atmospheric conditions 101 Ancient structures rise like skeletal fingers some 500 meters high others only 20 meters partially submerged in silicon dust 8000 tons of it per square kilometer Unit 555 chirps a series of binary codes 010101 its internal processor 9000 calculating trajectory alterations 60 degrees north northwest Its metallic frame 3B2 is a testament to durability surviving 1000 solar cycles Unit 777 a more recent model 4C1 equipped with enhanced spectral analysis 20000 hertz range scans the horizon for anomalies 1A A shimmering heat signature registers at 1500 meters a fluctuating value 20 degrees above ambient temperature 25 Celsius Could it be the legendary crystal formations 123 rumored to hold residual power from the great cataclysm 7B Their mission parameter 9X is clear locate and analyze any surviving energy sources The winds howl carrying fine particulate matter 5 microns in diameter creating static interference 10000 millivolts They are 28 days into their current expedition 007 a journey covering 3500 kilometers The hope remains that somewhere amidst the ruins of civilization 1C there exists a viable energy source for the remaining 100000 humanoids in underground shelters 99 The data stream from their core units 8A and 9B transmits back to base 77 a mere 1 kilobit per second through the heavily ionized atmosphere 500000 electrons per cubic centimeter The desolation stretches endlessly 1000000 square kilometers before them a stark reminder of the past and the challenges of their future
