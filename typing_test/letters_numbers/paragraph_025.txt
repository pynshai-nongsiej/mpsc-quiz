The chrono-navigator unit Designation Kilo7 hummed softly against my wrist displaying temporal drift variance at plus 0 point 3 percent a negligible anomaly for Sector Gamma 9 exploring the ruins of the old world city designated Area 51X. My mission objective was locating the Genesis Seed vault rumored to be hidden beneath the central obsidian tower structure number 1 a relic from the pre-Collapse era estimated year 3045. Navigating required constant cross-referencing of ancient grid coordinates like grid 44 Alpha and waypoint Epsilon 12 which appeared sporadically on my scanner screen amidst the pervasive electromagnetic interference level 5. Strange flora with bioluminescent properties pulsed rhythmically casting eerie green light across rusted metal husks and shattered ferroconcrete structures. I found a small metallic cube near a collapsed transit tunnel entrance designated Tunnel 3b its surface etched with symbols resembling the number 8 intertwined with the letter R suggesting a possible energy signature containment unit possibly type 8R serial number 9901. The air itself felt heavy thick with ozone and the faint scent of decay a constant reminder of the 900 cycles since the last recorded atmospheric event designated Skyfire 1. My suit registered background radiation at a steady 15 rads per hour well within safety parameters level 3 but the silence was unnerving broken only by the wind whistling through skeletal high-rise frames tower B4 and tower C1 were particularly unstable. I adjusted my path following a faint power conduit trace leading towards the tower number 1 base location coordinates 77 point 7 north latitude 101 point 2 west longitude. The Genesis Seed vault held the potential key to planetary restoration a project designated Operation Evergreen 2 according to the fragmented data logs recovered from Observation Post Delta 6. This expedition was critical failure was not an option failure meant stagnation cycle 7 continuation. I prepared the plasma cutter model XC 5000 set to aperture sequence Gamma 4 Beta 9.
