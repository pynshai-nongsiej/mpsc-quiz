Alpha7Delta was a desolate world its surface scarred by ancient impacts and recent geological upheavals its atmospheric composition displayed readings of 98 percent nitrogen and 2 percent trace elements including an unexpected isotope designated as Xynon303 by mission control the explorer unit designated as AstroBot9 encountered no indigenous life forms during its initial 1000 kilometer traverse only the incessant whine of solar winds against its titanium hull a constant reminder of its solitary mission the primary objective was data acquisition specifically sensor readings from geological stratum BetaLayer4 and atmospheric samples from QuadrantSigma7 the onboard AI designated as Cerebrum7 detected anomalous energy signatures emanating from a chasm designated as AbyssalVent9 a deep crevice extending downwards for an estimated 5000 meters the temperature gradient inside AbyssalVent9 dropped precipitously from an ambient 20 degrees Celsius to a frigid minus150 degrees Celsius at its lowest accessible point the light emitted from within was not natural spectrum radiation but a pulsating iridescent glow at 450 nanometers consistent with theoretical projections of uncontained plasma events AstroBot9 deployed its secondary investigative drone unit DroneScout1 for closer examination sending back encrypted telemetry data streams at 90000 bits per second the data included visual feeds of complex crystalline structures forming along the chasm walls seemingly growing and changing shape at a rate of 1 micron per hour AstroBot9 maintained its position 500 meters from the vent entrance awaiting further instructions from EarthBasePrime its power cells at 85 percent capacity its internal systems operating at optimal performance its last communication from EarthBasePrime was 23 hours 59 minutes 45 seconds ago its mission clock displayed 103 days 07 hours 12 minutes 01 second since deployment a deep hum now resonated from AbyssalVent9 indicating a significant energy surge a phenomenon designated as EventAlpha9 by the AI system it was a world of numbers and measurements a cold desolate expanse waiting for its secrets to be unveiled by the metallic fingers of exploration unit AstroBot9 and its silent watchful AI Cerebrum7 its journey across Alpha7Delta continued a testament to human ingenuity and machine endurance
