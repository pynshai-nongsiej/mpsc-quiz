The ancient vessel STARSONG4 had drifted through the vast emptiness of the XYLOS7 nebula for 300 years a ghost of the early 23rd century colonization era Its hull a metallic skeleton gleamed faintly under the distant light of triple star system KAPPA9 Inside maintenance drone UNIT207 began its routine diagnostic cycle scanning derelict crew quarters 5B and the long abandoned bridge 1A A single flickering emergency light 3E cast long distorted shadows across the control panels covered in a fine layer of cosmic dust accumulated since the great exodus of 2250 The onboard AI named OMEGA5 still hummed a low dormant frequency a reminder of its once complex operations guiding hundreds of colonists to planet NOVA12 Today only the faint whirring of UNIT207 disturbed the profound silence a silence stretching back to the mysterious energy surge of 2280 that crippled the ship and marooned its cryo-sleeping passengers in deep space UNIT207 detected an anomaly in cargo bay 7G a non-standard energy signature emanating from a locked container designated ARTIFACT88 This was unusual for a recovery mission focused purely on salvage and material reclamation by the EARTHCOALITION of 2500 Its programming protocol BETA17 did not include investigation of such a signature but a higher directive OVERRIDE9 initiated by central command HQ ALPHA3 compelled it to proceed The droneâ€™s optical sensors GLOW3 focused on the container its metallic surface showing faint scorch marks from some unknown internal event that occurred around 2295 The air was frigid 5 degrees Kelvin reflecting the ships core temperature a stark contrast to the 28 degrees Celsius of earths atmosphere UNIT207 accessed the lock mechanism 4P its arm extended a precision laser 6S cutting through hardened steel plating from the year 2270 Inside a pulsing blue light pulsed softly from a crystalline object not listed in any known database 1001 Its energy output registered at 900 terawatts a phenomenal power source completely alien to current human technology of the 26th century This was not mere salvage this was a discovery unlike any other in 500 years of space exploration
