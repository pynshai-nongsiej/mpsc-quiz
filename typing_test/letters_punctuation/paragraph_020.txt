The city, if one could even call it such a thing anymore, lay sunken and silent beneath an impossible canopy of phosphorescent flora. Every street, every alley, every crumbling façade of what once might have been a bustling marketplace or a stately governmental edifice, was now utterly consumed by a riotous, alien greenery that pulsed with an internal, ethereal glow. Vines as thick as a man’s torso coiled around obsidian spires, their luminous tendrils unfurling like celestial banners in the perpetually dim, humid air. Mosses, thick and velvety, carpeted the ground in shades of deep indigo and shimmering emerald, absorbing all sound, creating an oppressive quietude broken only by the drip of unseen condensation from the towering, bioluminescent trees. Structures that were clearly engineered, perhaps even monuments to a lost civilization, buckled and groaned under the relentless pressure of this vegetal invasion, their intricate carvings now blurred and softened by layers of creeping lichen. A faint, almost imperceptible hum, like the distant song of forgotten machinery, seemed to emanate from the very heart of this vegetative labyrinth, a testament to some forgotten power still lingering. No animal sound, no human trace, just the overwhelming, vibrant silence of a world entirely reclaimed, a living monument to nature’s inexorable dominion, forever breathing its slow, luminous breath into the endless night.
