The air, thick and viscous as forgotten honey, clung to every surface within the Whispering Mire, a place only ever glimpsed in feverish dreams or the oldest, dustiest folios of forbidden lore. Ancient, skeletal trees, their bark like desiccated parchment and branches gnarled into grotesque supplications, pierced the perpetual twilight that suffused the sunken basin, their exposed roots, thick as a leviathan’s arteries, disappearing into the putrid, shimmering bog. A sickly luminescence, the hue of an anemic moon, pulsed from the marsh’s depths, illuminating the skeletal fragments of what once must have been colossal structures, now merely colossal, moss-choked silhouettes, their impossible angles hinting at architects from a cosmic periphery. The silence was profound, broken only by the occasional, unsettling gurgle of gas from below or the distant, reedy cry of some unseen, unseen avian predator patrolling the higher, unseen reaches. Every step on the spongy, organic carpet of decaying vegetation felt like an intrusion, a desecration, disturbing the long-held slumber of this forgotten world, whose secrets, immense and terrifying, lay just beneath the stagnant, mirror-like surface. One could almost hear the faint echo of forgotten tongues, a cacophony of sorrow and worship, whispering through the skeletal boughs, pulling the mind into an abyss of chilling realization that this desolate beauty was merely the tomb of something truly magnificent, something utterly beyond human comprehension or even mortal fear.
