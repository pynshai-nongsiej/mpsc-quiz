The air in the Grand Scriptorium hung thick and ancient, a palpable veil of dust and forgotten knowledge that coated the very breath drawn. Sunbeams, fractured and weary, struggled through lofty, grimy windows, illuminating motes that danced in an eternal, silent ballet, each particle a minuscule, spinning nebula of antiquity. Row upon row, shelves stretched into a dizzying, shadowy infinity, their dark timber groaning under the immeasurable weight of volumes bound in leathers of every conceivable creature, or perhaps, of no creature known to the common world. Some covers pulsed faintly with an inner luminescence, a soft, emerald glow or a deep, amethyst throb, hinting at the potent, volatile narratives contained within. Others hummed, a low, resonant thrum that vibrated through the very soles of one’s worn boots, speaking of tales sung in a language older than stars. A faint, sweet scent, like dried herbs and distant rain, wafted from a section where vellum scrolls unrolled themselves slowly, revealing calligraphic patterns that shifted and rewove themselves before one’s very eyes, never quite settling into a stable form. The silence itself was not empty, but rather a profound, breathing entity, filled with the whisper of turning pages unseen, the soft rustle of invisible ink drying, and the vast, collective sigh of stories awaiting their next reader, a solitary soul lost amidst the planet’s accumulated lore.
