The shimmer from the Chronos-Gate, installed precisely at coordinates 47.88N, 122.99W, pulsed with an unsettling emerald light, a frequency measured at 3.14159 hertz, echoing through the desolate, salt-crusted plains of Xylos-7. Dr. Aris Thorne, his vintage, brass-fitted chronometer displaying 23:59:58, adjusted his ancient spectacles, the lenses smudged from countless, futile attempts to decipher the cryptic glyphs etched onto the Gate's obsidian frame. He recalled Professor Eldridge's final, frantic message, "The convergence is imminent! Sector Gamma-9, portal instability approaching 98.7%!" That warning, received nearly 72 hours ago, had spurred this desperate, last-ditch expedition. Beneath his worn, patched-up jumpsuit, his heart hammered a chaotic rhythm, a drumbeat of anticipation and dread. The air, thin and metallic, carried the faint, decaying scent of ozone and something else, somethingâ€¦ preternatural. A sudden jolt, a surge of energy registering 9.2 on the temporal displacement scale, shook the very ground. Pebbles, no larger than a child's thumb, vibrated off the Gate's base, scattering like startled insects. Was this it? The moment the fabric of space-time would tear, revealing what lay beyond the 5th dimension, or merely another calibration failure, like the 12,000 others they'd documented since 2142? His comm-link crackled, a voice, tinny and panicked, "Commander, we're seeing an energy spike of 1.6 x 10^7 joules! Recommend immediate evacuation! Repeat, immediate evacuation!" Aris, ignoring the frantic plea, reached out a trembling hand, just as the Gate's core flared, its light now blinding, engulfing everything in a silence more profound than any vacuum, a silence that hummed with untold possibilities, or perhaps, ultimate oblivion. The countdown, etched invisibly onto his mind, ticked down to 00:00:00.
