The derelict server farm, designated "Echo-7" on old star charts, hummed with a low, barely perceptible thrum, a ghostly resonance from its operational zenith 347 cycles ago. Commander Lyra "Ghost" Thorne, her environmental suit a dull metallic sheen under the flickering emergency lights that occasionally strobed through the cavernous space, navigated the labyrinthine aisles. Row upon row, colossal data towers, some leaning precariously at 23.5-degree angles, stretched into the gloom, each unit bearing a faded serial number like "QX-9003b" or "Unit 774-Gamma-Prime." Dust, thick and unsettlingly fine, coated everything, creating miniature dunes on the polished durasteel floor, disturbed only by Lyra’s methodical boots, size 11, specifically designed for lunar expeditions. She was searching for "Project Nightingale," a rumored AI core said to possess blueprints for the "Void Engines," a technology that could shift reality itself, or so the legends claimed; a desperate hope for the fractured colonies after the Great Collapse of 2242. Her wrist-mounted diagnostic tool, its screen displaying an erratic 0.07% power reading, pinged, indicating an anomaly near Sector 4B, an area marked on ancient schematics as "Restricted: Biohazard Level III – No Entry Without Authorization 001." A chill, not entirely due to the lunar vacuum outside, permeated her suit as she approached a massive blast door, its surface marred by three distinct impact points and a faded red symbol: a screaming eye. The air here was strangely still, devoid even of the faint hum that pervaded the rest of the facility. "Just a few more meters," she whispered to herself, her breath misting inside her helmet, "then maybe, just maybe, 1,000,000 lives won't be lost." The door groaned, a sound that seemed to reverberate through her very bones, as she initiated the manual override sequence, punching in the seven-digit code "881-alpha-92-delta" from a frayed note found earlier.
