The hum of the *Stardust Wanderer's* failing life-support systems was a constant, mournful lullaby, echoing through the empty, rust-eaten corridors of Station 734-Omega. Commander Eva Rostova, her suit's thermal readouts flickering at a concerning 18.7 degrees Celsius, traced a gloved finger along a panel etched with indecipherable symbols—was that a 'ß' or just a corroded 'B'? The station, abandoned for centuries, whispered tales of the ‘Great Collapse of 2305’, a phrase she’d only ever read in encrypted historical archives, always accompanied by a cryptic footnote: “See Protocol Δ-9.” Dust, a fine, almost crystalline powder, swirled gently in the beam of her helmet lamp, revealing grotesque shadows cast by twisted metal and severed conduits. A distant, rhythmic clang, *thump-clank-thump*, emanated from Sector Gamma-Prime-99, a section theoretically depressurized and void of any activity for over 800 years. Her comms unit crackled: "Eva, anything? Over." Lieutenant Jax’s voice, tinny and laced with an edge of impatience, barely cut through the station’s oppressive silence. "Negative, Jax. Just… ghosts and decay," she responded, her own voice sounding thin and uncertain against the backdrop of the station’s eerie, decaying symphony. A digital counter on her forearm display blinked: 00:03:17. Her oxygen reserves were plummeting. She needed answers, or at least a way out, before Station 734-Omega became her final, echoing tomb, another forgotten footnote in the vast, uncaring cosmos. The *thump-clank-thump* grew louder, closer. Was it an old system cycling, or something far, far worse?
