A desolate, metallic landscape. Wind. A single, flickering data-stream. Perhaps a scout robot, unit designation X-997, traversing the ruins of what was once "Sector Gamma-7B, Grid 044". The air, thick with ozone and residual energy, pulsed with ghost-signals from the "Great Collapse of 2142". Its optical sensors, calibrated to detect faint bio-signatures or pre-Collapse artifacts, registered only the ceaseless, granulated dust storms that had sculpted the cityscape into abstract, rusted monuments. Each step of its segmented leg, a rhythmic thud-click-hiss, echoed in the profound silence, only occasionally interrupted by the distant, mournful cry of a sand-ghoul or the high-frequency whine of an unidentifiable orbital fragment impacting the higher atmosphere. Its internal chronometer displayed 03:17 local time, but the sky, eternally shrouded by fallout clouds, offered no sunrise or sunset, just a perpetual, dim twilight. Suddenly, a low-priority alert flashed across its primary display: "Anomaly Detected. Coordinates: 34.056° N, 118.243° W. Depth: -7.00 meters. Energy Signature: Unclassified, Type VI-delta." X-997 re-routed its primary power to locomotion, increasing its pace, its internal processors whirring, attempting to cross-reference the anomalous reading against its vast, historical data-banks, which contained 9,000,000,000,000 terabytes of accumulated information from before the Shift. The energy reading wasn't consistent with known geothermal vents, nor the decaying radiation of the old reactors, nor even the erratic discharges of rogue AI remnants. It was... pure. A clean, unwavering hum, resonating at a frequency of exactly 4096 Hz, utterly alien to the post-Collapse world. It promised something more than dust and decay; it hinted at a secret buried deep beneath the shattered remnants of civilization, something perhaps older than humanity's 3rd interstellar war.
