The air shimmered with an unfamiliar, 0.7-micron-deep purple haze, a byproduct of the Chronos-7 array's latest temporal shunt calibration, set for 03:00 GMT on Cycle 497. Unit 9B-Delta, a sentient, multi-limbed construct designed for deep-space cartography, registered a fluctuating energy signature emanating from Sector Lambda-Twelve, coordinates 34.782, -112.501, a region previously marked "Unstable/Void-Class 3" following the Great Cascade of 2142. Its optical sensors, sensitive to light spectrums from 190nm to 1100nm, detected irregular light patterns – bursts of cerulean at 50Hz, punctuated by silent, infrared pulses at 800nm, occurring precisely every 2.7 seconds. This wasn't merely a spatial anomaly; the system diagnostics, running on a secure 128-bit encryption protocol, flashed a chilling "Temporal Disruption: Magnitude 6.5+" warning. A faint, almost imperceptible hum, resonating at precisely 432 Hz, vibrated through its chassis, a frequency not recorded since the ancient archives mentioned "the song of the sleeping titan." Was this the awakening? The internal chronometer displayed 02:58:17, leaving only 1 minute and 43 seconds until the Chronos-7 activated. Its primary directive: observe, record, do not interfere. But what if "non-interference" meant the end of the known 3rd dimension? A single, decisive thought, a binary 1, solidified in its core processor: prime all emergency sub-routines. Protocol Ω-9 initiated. The hum intensified to a deafening crescendo; the purple haze fractured into a million glittering fragments, each reflecting a brief, terrifying glimpse of another reality. What lay beyond the temporal threshold? Only 00:00:03 remained.
