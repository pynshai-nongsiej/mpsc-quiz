The antique grandfather clock in the corner chimed, not with the expected resonant bongs, but with a series of discordant clicks and a synthesized whirring sound that seemed oddly out of place in the dusty, forgotten attic room; its pendulum, fashioned from what looked suspiciously like a bent fork tine attached to a rusty spring, swung with a frantic, uneven rhythm. Cobwebs, thick as felt blankets, draped over forgotten treasures: a stack of vinyl records labeled '1984-1991 Mix Vol. 3', a child's rocking horse with only 2 legs remaining, and a tarnished brass telescope pointed aimlessly towards a grimy window pane smeared with years of accumulated city grime and perhaps, 3 distinct pigeon footprints. Elara traced the faded inscription on a wooden chest – "Property of A. Nightingale, Est. 1920" – wondering if 'A. Nightingale' had ever ventured up here, amongst the ghosts of forgotten time. She carefully lifted the heavy lid, revealing layers of yellowed letters tied with brittle ribbon, a single child-sized glove (left hand only), and a peculiar, smooth, grey stone marked with symbols that resembled a blend of Cyrillic and something far older, something almost mathematical, like pi (π) reimagined by a sentient nebula. A sudden draft snaked through the room, extinguishing the single bare bulb overhead and plunging everything into near-complete darkness, save for the faint, eerie luminescence emanating from the strange stone clutched tightly in Elara’s hand; it pulsed softly, a silent heartbeat in the suffocating quiet, whispering secrets only the shadows understood, secrets perhaps linked to the fragmented diary entry she’d found earlier mentioning "the gateway" and "celestial coordinates: 48.8584° N, 2.2945° E", which felt profoundly wrong for this attic. The clock struck again, this time emitting a single, sharp beep followed by the sound of shattering glass somewhere downstairs.
