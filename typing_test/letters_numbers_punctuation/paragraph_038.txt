The air, thick with a lavender haze and an acrid, metallic tang, pulsed faintly with the hum of the Xylos-7 beacon, its rhythmic *thrum-thrum-thrum* echoing across the obsidian plains. Below the perpetually dim, twin suns – one a bruised violet, the other a flickering emerald – the landscape unfolded, a geometrically improbable mosaic of crystalline spires that rose hundreds of meters, their facets catching the alien light and refracting it into a dizzying kaleidoscope of non-Euclidean angles. A small, armored scout vessel, the *Stardust Drifter IV*, its hull scarred from countless atmospheric re-entries, lay half-buried in a crater near coordinate 34.78N, 112.56W, its single operational viewport displaying an internal temperature of 23.5 degrees Celsius, barely fending off the external -87.1 degrees. Inside, Captain Elara Vance, her fingers tracing the holographic schematic of the nearest power conduit – a circuit designated P27G-gamma-9 – exhaled a plume of condensed vapor. Her comm unit had been dead for precisely 07:43:19 standard hours, a silence more unnerving than any of the audible threats she’d faced in 20 cycles of deep-space salvage. The last transmission, garbled and choked, had mentioned 'Pattern Gamma-3,' 'anomalous energy signatures,' and a 'countdown initiated,' before dissolving into static, leaving only the Xylos-7's relentless, unhelpful beat. She had only 1,500 units of reserve power left, enough for maybe another 48 hours if she conserved diligently, but not nearly enough to power the distress signal that could pierce the atmospheric interference. The metallic tang in the air seemed to deepen, carrying with it a new, almost imperceptible vibration, originating from somewhere beyond the 300-meter peak of the nearest crystalline spire.
