The year 2347, cycle 8, dawned with a metallic shriek from the Sector 7B wind-farm, a sound Zylos knew too well. His chronometer, a battered relic from Pre-Collapse Era 3, blinked 04:37, its ancient diodes struggling against the pervasive damp. Outside the habitation unit – a repurposed shipping container, model RX-99, serial D77-3G – the perpetual acid rain sizzled on the durasteel plating, eroding centuries of forgotten industry. Today was Collection Day, a grim ritual mandated by the Central Registry Decree 12.4. Every citizen, from the youngest 5-cycle old to the oldest 80-cycle elder, was required to surrender 75% of their daily nutrient paste ration. Failure to comply, as Section 9.1b of the Code of Sustenance sternly reminded, resulted in immediate re-assignment to the lower mines, Level Gamma-9, an existence few survived beyond 100 sun-cycles. Zylos clutched his dented nutrient tube, its contents barely enough for a single mouth-cycle, let alone the mandated surrender. He wondered about Unit 404, his neighbor, who had mysteriously vanished last week after an unregistered power surge in his hydro-reclamation unit; the Official Report 618 merely stated 'technical difficulties, unit decommissioned.' The air, thick with the scent of ozone and recycled humanity, pressed in. He knew the Overseer Drones, Mark IV, equipped with thermal scanners and acoustic sensors accurate to 0.003 decibels, would be patrolling soon. Their red optical lenses, like malevolent eyes, would seek out any deviation, any whisper of non-compliance. The countdown on his chronometer clicked to 04:38. Time to face the day, another pixel in the vast, grey mosaic of regulated survival.
