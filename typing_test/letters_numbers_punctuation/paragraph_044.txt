The air in Sector 7B, a relic of 2042, hummed with a low, dying thrum; it was the failing pulse of the ancient grid, a testament to neglect. Rust-streaked automatons, their chassis bearing the faded designation "Custodian-Alpha 003" or "Logistics-Unit 9.7", juddered along the cracked synth-pavement, performing routines long obsolete, delivering phantom packages to non-existent addresses. A perpetual haze, thick with industrial dust and the scent of ozone, clung to the skeletal high-rises, each window a black, vacant eye staring into the smoggy abyss. Below, amidst the collapsing infrastructure, a single, flickering neon sign, "DATA-MART: ALL SYSTEMS GO!", spat static like a dying organism, its message a cruel, ironic jest. Every few minutes, a distant, metallic shriek – perhaps a forgotten transport drone, Model XP-11, finally succumbing to gravity – echoed through the canyons of derelict steel and glass. One could almost hear the city itself sighing, a long, drawn-out exhalation of despair. The temperature had dropped to 3.7 degrees Celsius overnight, a chill that seeped into your very bones, bypassing the threadbare cloak Kaelen wore, a cloak scavenged from Level -2, Compartment 4B, marked with the indelible stain of some unknown chemical spill. He was searching, always searching, for the fabled "Core Processor 88G," rumored to hold the last true archive of pre-Collapse human history, a whisper passed between the few remaining scavengers, like a forgotten lullaby. Was it real? Could it provide answers, or just more questions? His comm-link, a cracked 'Comm-2000' unit, remained stubbornly silent, displaying only "NO SIGNAL: ERROR 505-C" against its cracked screen. The silence, punctuated only by the occasional clank or groan of the city's slow demise, was deafening. He adjusted his thermal goggles, their display showing fluctuating heat signatures – perhaps just phantom readings from the decaying metal, or something else entirely?
