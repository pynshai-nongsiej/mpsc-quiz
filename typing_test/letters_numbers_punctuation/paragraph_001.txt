The air above Neo-Veridia, designated Sector 7-Delta, shimmered with a perpetual, almost liquid luminescence, a side-effect of the atmospheric purifiers and the millions of integrated bioluminescent panels that adorned every sky-skimmer and floating domicile. Below the lowest cloud stratum, which was itself a manufactured atmospheric membrane at an altitude of 3,000 meters, the city unfurled like an impossibly intricate botanical garden, its chrome-petal towers reaching for the distant, ever-present glow of the orbital power relays. Whispers of wind, carrying the faint, high-pitched hum of grav-motors, were the only persistent sound, broken occasionally by the rhythmic thrum of a passing cargo leviathan, its belly overflowing with synthesized nutrient paste or raw ore from the asteroid mines of Belt 9. Children, their faces illuminated by the soft, scrolling advertisements projected onto the sheer, transparent walls of their aerial nurseries, chased iridescent data-moths, their laughter echoing briefly before being absorbed by the vast, silent expanse. No ground was visible, only an endless, undulating ocean of clouds, sometimes parting to reveal the distant, glinting silver of ancient, abandoned satellites, forgotten relics from the 21st century. Even the oldest residents, those who remembered the 'Earth-bound' tales, found themselves increasingly disconnected from the concept of a solid surface, living lives perpetually suspended, their dreams woven from light and the silent, inexorable drift towards an unknown future, guided by algorithms and the subtle flickers of their omnipresent data-screens, displaying information like 'TEMP: 23C, HUMIDITY: 65%, POP: 17,345,902, STATUS: NOMINAL_BETA-7'.
