The chrome-plated spires of Neo-Veridia pierced the perpetual twilight, their apexes occasionally wreathed in the luminescent haze of atmospheric filters. From his 73rd-floor aerie, Kaelen watched the incessant flow of grav-cars, each a tiny, humming insect in the city's vast, intricate web. It was precisely 03:17, according to his wrist-com, yet the district below, Sector Alpha-9, throbbed with the unyielding pulse of commerce and clandestine operations. He'd seen so much from this vantage point: the swift, silent swoop of corporate drones, the intermittent, shimmering portals that winked into existence near the old Citadel Districtâ€”rumored gateways to forgotten dimensions, or perhaps just elaborate holographic displays designed to deter unauthorized access. Today, however, something was different. A flicker, not of light, but of absence, rippled through the central data-stream tower, Tower 101, causing its millions of intricate fibre-optic cables to momentarily dim, a gasp of shadow in the city's ceaseless glow. Then, just as swiftly, the light returned, even brighter, pulsating with an intensity that made the ferro-glass of Kaelen's window vibrate slightly. Was it merely a power surge, a glitch in the city's ancient, overtaxed grid, or something more? The air grew strangely still; even the usual hum of distant sky-trains seemed to cease for a breathless second. A solitary, crimson flash erupted from the very peak of Tower 101, arcing across the obsidian sky towards the distant, uninhabited wastes beyond the city's outermost barrier, Wall 17. He pressed his palm against the cool pane, his breath fogging the view for a moment, a singular question forming: what had just been launched, and to where? The city, always vibrant, now held a new, ominous silence, a promise of unknown futures, perhaps catastrophic ones, certainly ones that defied his usual, predictable observations of the concrete jungle below.
