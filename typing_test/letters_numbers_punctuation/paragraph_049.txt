The air, thick with the metallic tang of centuries-old rust and the fainter, almost imperceptible whisper of ozone, clung to Kaelen's rebreather mask as he navigated the skeletal remains of Sector 17-Gamma. Below, the city of Veridian Prime stretched, a vast, decaying organism of collapsed sky-spires and shattered plasteel domes, all bathed in the sickly amber glow of Xylos-7's binary sunset. It was Cycle 347, year 2874 according to the last functioning chronological beacon Kaelen had found, a relic of the Old World's grand delusion. His drone, Unit 9T-Alpha, its photoreceptors glowing a steady, inquisitive blue, hummed softly just above his shoulder, scanning for any residual energy signatures from the fabled 'Chrono-Cores' â€“ rumored power sources capable of manipulating localized temporal fields. Every twenty-five paces, a low, guttural growl echoed from the subterranean levels, a chilling reminder of the forgotten fauna that now claimed the depths; thankfully, no Mark III series automated defense units had activated yet, their cold, red optical arrays a constant, lingering dread. He pushed a stray, sparking cable, labelled 'Conduit-Delta-404-A', aside with his boot, its frayed insulation crumbling to fine dust. The silence, punctuated only by his own ragged breaths and Unit 9T-Alpha's ceaseless thrum, was profound, a heavy blanket woven from abandonment and the countless, untold stories of those who had once thrived here, long before the Great Silence descended and turned humanity's brightest achievements into forgotten, desolate mausoleums across this dead-end quadrant of the galaxy.
