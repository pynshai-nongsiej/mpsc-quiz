A vast, silent hulk, the *Chronos-7* orbital platform drifted through the asteroid belt, its once-gleaming solar sails ripped to tattered banners by a thousand forgotten micrometeoroid impacts. For centuries, it had been a ghost, a monument to a failed deep-space colonization project, its primary reactor, *Nucleus-Alpha 3*, supposedly offline since 2342. Yet, within its labyrinthine corridors, a faint, rhythmic hum persisted, a sound barely audible above the whispers of cosmic dust against warped hull plating. Section Gamma-9, the old botanical research bay, now a zero-G arboretum of desiccated alien flora, occasionally registered flickering lights, a phantom current surging through defunct conduits, painting fleeting shadows across skeletal structures. Automated defense turrets, their barrels crusted with the detritus of millennia, sometimes whirred, tracking non-existent threats, their targeting lasers, *Red-Eyes 001*, briefly illuminating sections of the vacuum. A solitary, pre-programmed maintenance bot, designated Unit 88-Delta, its optical sensors cracked but still functional, continued its endless patrol, sweeping non-existent debris, its internal clock stubbornly ticking, reporting "All Systems Nominal" to a defunct central AI that no longer processed data. Its last log entry, dated 2341.10.27, described the station's final, desperate moments, the evacuation codes (EVE-99-Beta) flashing across control panels, the faint hope of rescue before the long silence. Now, only the hum, the phantom lights, and the tireless bot remained, a testament to a forgotten future, drifting endlessly, a metallic mausoleum in the cold, unforgiving vastness of space, awaiting perhaps a 24th-century scavenger or another 500 years of oblivion.
