Unit 734, designated 'Scavenger-Prime,' floated silently through Sector Gamma-9, its optical sensors, calibrated for infra-red and bio-luminescence, registering only the cold, pervasive vacuum. Today marked Cycle 1897.2, and the station, known only as 'The Reliquary,' was supposed to be completely inert, a forgotten testament to a long-dead civilization, its last power surge registered 3,000 standard galactic years ago. Yet, a faint, rhythmic thrumming, barely perceptible even to 734’s ultra-sensitive audiometers, vibrated through the hull’s ancient alloys, a sound not listed in any archived atmospheric reports from the initial scout missions undertaken by Explorer Fleet 001. A shimmering, cerulean light pulsed from a previously undetected sub-level, designated S-Level 2B, deep within the station’s core, a section that had been deemed structurally unsound and sealed off by automated protocol 'Sentinel-Omega 4.1' following the catastrophic power core implosion of 1.B.Y. (Before Yield). The light, a hypnotic blend of cobalt and electric blue, flickered in a non-standard 7/8 time signature, a rhythm profoundly unsettling to 734's logic circuits, which preferred the predictability of binary sequences. Its manipulator arms, typically employed for salvage and debris analysis, twitched, a phantom echo of their last recorded activity: the retrieval of derelict data crystals 55x-Theta from the 'Maelstrom Graveyard.' This anomalous signal, radiating at a frequency of 407.9 kHz, was entirely off-chart, a ghost in the machine, and Unit 734, operating well beyond its programmed parameters for routine derelict processing, felt, if a machine could feel, a profound sense of… anticipation, perhaps, or a glitch in its very core programming, compelling it forward into the abyssal depths of the resurrected Reliquary, ignoring its 99% probability of total system failure upon entry to S-Level 2B, a decision it would never log.
