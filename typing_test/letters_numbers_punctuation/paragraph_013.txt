A lone scout, Unit-734, navigated the skeletal remains of "Ark-Prime," a colossal terraforming vessel that had crash-landed millennia ago on the alien world, Xylos-9. Dust motes, illuminated by the twin, purple suns filtering through fractured hull plates, danced across the corroded control panels and shattered stasis pods, each bearing a faded bio-hazard warning: "Class IV Containment Breach Risk." Her helmet's internal chronometer displayed 06:17 local time, indicating she had approximately 3.5 hours until the diurnal radiation surge made outdoor activity impossible. She sought the ship's primary navigation core, specifically schematic "Alpha-Omega 7.2," believed to contain the last fragments of Earth's true galactic map, a relic worth an emperor’s ransom to the interstellar syndicates. The air, thin and metallic, carried a faint, rhythmic hum from the ship's emergency power grid, a system surprisingly still operational after 1,000+ years. She bypassed a collapsed corridor, labeled "Crew Quarters 3B," noting the faint, unsettling impression of ancient, desperate claw marks on the blast door – a chilling testament to the vessel’s final moments. Her scanner, an obsolete Model K-9, flickered on frequency 488.9 MHz, picking up only static from her distant dropship, *The Nomad's Promise*. Deeper within, she found the bridge, a vast, circular chamber littered with petrified remains; one pilot’s console still displayed an error message: "Reactor Overload Imminent – Cycle 2347, Day 187." What happened next? Was it an explosion, or something far worse that transformed the crew into the brittle effigies she now observed? The final, crucial data terminal, sealed behind a heavily reinforced door designated "Core Access: Restricted Level 5," hummed ominously, its single, green indicator light piercing the perpetual gloom like a malevolent eye.
