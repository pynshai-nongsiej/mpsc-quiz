XR-7 activated the landing sequence, the 'Stardust Nomad' dipping through Xylos's thin, methane-tinged atmosphere at precisely 1.2 Mach. External sensors registered temperatures fluctuating between -85°C and -90°C, well within the suit's operational parameters, thankfully. The landing struts deployed with a hydraulic hiss, settling onto a plain shimmering with amethyst-like crystal formations that pulsed faintly with internal bioluminescence. Initial atmospheric analysis confirmed a 78% nitrogen, 19% argon, and trace amounts of methane and xenon – breathable? Absolutely not without the Mark IV enviro-suit, which hummed reassuringly, maintaining internal pressure at a comfortable 101.3 kPa. Gravity felt like a gentle suggestion, approximately 0.6g, allowing XR-7 to bound across the violet terrain with surprising ease. Strange, six-legged herbivores, resembling metallic insects scaled up to the size of small dogs (estimated length: 1.5 meters), grazed placidly on the crystalline 'grass'. The ship's long-range scanners picked up unusual energy signatures emanating from a mountain range approximately 15 kilometers to the north-east, designated Sector Gamma-9. Could this be evidence of prior civilization, or merely a complex geological phenomenon? The mission directive was clear: investigate anomalies. XR-7 checked the chrono-display: 14:32 Galactic Standard Time. Time to deploy the survey drone, 'Pathfinder 3', and begin preliminary mapping before venturing towards those intriguing Gamma-9 readings. The silence was profound, broken only by the crunch of crystal shards underfoot and the omnipresent electronic whisper of life support. A 98% chance of mission success seemed optimistic, but the potential discovery warranted the risk. XR-7 uploaded the initial landing data to the orbital relay station, transmitting coordinates 34.15° N, 118.92° W (relative to the planet's primary magnetic pole). This world, Xylos, felt ancient, brimming with secrets waiting beneath its glittering, alien surface; a quick scan revealed 3 new mineral types, cataloged as Xylo-1, Xylo-2, and the elusive Xylo-4, noted for its unusual density reading of 8.5 g/cm³.
