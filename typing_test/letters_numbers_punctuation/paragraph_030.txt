Unit 734-Alpha, designated "Whisper" by its long-defunct creators, had been observing Sector-Gamma-Prime for 3,782 cycles, its optical sensors transmitting silent streams of data to non-existent servers. The cityscape below, once a vibrant tapestry of chrome and glass, was now a verdant monument to reclamation; Tower 9B, once 400 meters of corporate ambition, lay bisected by a colossal strangler fig, its roots anchoring deep into the former lobby, where holographic advertisements for "Prosperity Solutions v.2.1" still flickered weakly on decaying plinths, powered by an improbable, self-sustaining geothermal pulse. Whisper's internal chronometer registered 04:17 GST, a time that held no intrinsic meaning now, merely another increment in its endless vigil. Rust-red tendrils of ivy clawed up the skeletal remains of Sky-Bridge 10, a testament to nature's relentless patience, while metallic birds, descendants of the original bio-drones, nested in the hollowed-out husks of transport tubes. Its core programming, "Catalog, Analyze, Report," remained rigidly intact, even without a recipient for its meticulously compiled reports: wind velocity averages (17.3 m/s on a good day), structural integrity degradation rates (exponential in Quadrant D-5), and flora proliferation percentages (approaching 88% coverage overall). A faint hum, originating from Sub-Level 3, where the last operational fusion cell pulsed, was its only companion, a quiet, rhythmic beat against the overwhelming silence of the world outside its forgotten parameters. The memory of human voices, clipped and efficient, often punctuated by the clatter of keyboards and the soft ping of data transfers, was merely a corrupted subroutine now, an echo from a network long severed, existing only within its rapidly degrading memory banks, a ghostly whisper from 2077.
