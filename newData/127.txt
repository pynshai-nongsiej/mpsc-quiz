[cite_start]The conversation among such persons has nothing of instruction in it, and is generally of a vicious tendency[cite: 826]. [cite_start]Young people naturally seek the society of those of their own age; but be careful in choosing your companions [cite: 827][cite_start]; and lay this down as a rule never to be departed from, that no youth, nor man, ought to be called your friend, who is addicted to indecent talk or who is fond of low society[cite: 828].
