Directions (Q. Nos. 22-25): In the following questions, some of the sentences have errors and some have none. Find out which part of a sentence (A), (B) or (C) has an error and select that part as the answer. If there is no error, then (D) is the answer.

22. (A) He was (B) very delighted (C) to hear of his success. (D) No error
Answer: (B) very delighted (The error is using 'very' with the past participle 'delighted' to form an adjective expressing a strong emotion; 'very' is generally used with weak adjectives, while 'much' or 'greatly' is more suitable with strong emotional past participles like delighted or pleased. However, in modern usage, 'very delighted' is increasingly common, but traditionally the use of 'much delighted' or 'greatly delighted' is considered more correct. Since a part is likely to be marked as an error, (B) is the intended answer in a traditional grammar test.) **Correction:** He was **much/greatly** delighted.

23. (A) I request you (B) to kindly (C) to help my father. (D) No error
Answer: (B) to kindly (The error is in part (B). 'Kindly' is an adverb and should ideally be placed before the verb 'help', or the redundancy of 'request' and 'kindly' should be noted. However, the use of two 'to' infinitives or the placement of 'kindly' is often flagged. The most common error pattern here is the unnecessary use of 'kindly' with 'request'. The simplest way to correct is to omit 'kindly': I request you to help my father. If 'kindly' is kept, it should be: I request you kindly to help my father.) **Correction:** I request you **to** help my father.

24. (A) The murderer (B) was hanged (C) yesterday. (D) No error
Answer: (D) No error (The verb 'to hang' has two past forms: 'hanged' for a person and 'hung' for an object. Since a person (the murderer) is involved, 'was hanged' is correct. The sentence is grammatically correct.)

25. (A) We regret (B) for the delay (C) in sending the message. (D) No error
Answer: (B) for the delay (The error is the preposition 'for'. The verb 'regret' does not take the preposition 'for' when followed by a noun or a gerund phrase. It should be: We regret **the delay** or We regret **delaying** the message.) **Correction:** We regret **the delay** in sending the message.
