Directions: Read the following passage and answer the questions given below following the instructions:
Drug addiction is a great social menace, a malady which has assumed an alarming proportion in recent times. It is eating into the vitals of the youth who are the future hopes of the country. This is now a worldwide phenomenon and Indian youth are also succumbing to its disastrous tentacles. Drugs like heroin, brown sugar and L.S.D become a habit to the people and once they have a taste of it, they become their slaves. It is feared that if no corrective measures are taken immediately, it may be too late to save the society from this destructive vice.

Sociologists think that some youth succumb to drugs out of frustration. Sometimes they take to it out of sheer fun. But once they get a taste of it they become addicted. Drug addiction may also come from parental neglect, ignorance and loneliness. The result of drug addiction is calamitous like slow poisoning. All out measures should be taken by the government to curb drug addiction. Drug peddlers should be heavily punished. Efforts should be made by the government and social organisation to rehabilitate drug addicts and help them to find their bearings in society again.
