Directions: (Q. No. 6-10) In these questions, some of the sentences have errors and some have none. Find out which part of a sentence a, b, c, d has an error and select that part as an answer. If there is no error, then (d) is the answer.

7. The matter will soon (a) / be dealt with (b)/ Have you anything more to ask? (c)/No Error (d)
*Error in (c) - It should be a statement in this context, or "Do you have anything more to ask?" if it must be a question. However, based on the options, this part seems to be the one with a stylistic or punctuation issue, but comparing (a) and (b), they are correct. Assuming the error is not in the verb/tense in (a) or (b).*
