PASSAGE:
Walking back home, he pondered over it. 'Why are they all behaving like this, as if I were a mad man?' When the word came to his mind, he stopped abruptly at the end of the road, and, cried 'Oh! that's it, is that it?-Mad! Mad!' He shook his head gleefully as if the full truth had just dawned upon him. He now understood the looks that people threw at him. 'Oh! Oh!' he cried aloud. He laughed. He felt a curious relief at this realisation. 'I have been mad and didn't know it ...'. He cast his mind back. Every action of his for the last so many days seemed mad particularly the doll-making. 'What sane man would make clay dolls after twenty five years of respectable service in an office?' He felt a tremendous freedom of limbs, and didn't feel it possible to walk at an ordinary pace. He wanted to fly. He swung his arms up and down and ran on with a whoop.
