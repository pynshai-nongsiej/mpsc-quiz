Each question carries 2 marks:

SECTION-I
A. Read the following passage and answer the questions below following the instructions:

[cite_start]Young people naturally seek the society of those of their own age; but be careful in choosing your companions [cite: 290][cite_start]; and lay this down as a rule never to be departed from, that no youth nor man, ought to be called your friend, who is addicted to indecent talk or who is fond of low society[cite: 291]. [cite_start]Either of these argues a depraved taste and even a depraved heart [cite: 292][cite_start]; an absence of all principles and trustworthiness and I have remarked it my life long, that young men, addicted to these vices, never succeed in the end whatever advantages they may have whether in fortune or in talent[cite: 293]. [cite_start]Fond mothers and fathers are too apt to be over lenient to such offenders [cite: 294][cite_start]; and as long as youth and fortune smiles, the punishment is deferred; but it comes at last [cite: 295][cite_start]; it is sure to come; and the gay and dissolute youth is a dejected and miserable man[cite: 296].
