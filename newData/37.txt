Directions (Q. Nos. 11-15) Read the following passage and answer the questions that follow.

PASSAGE:
The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as 'the lungs of the Earth', is one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. Covering over 5.5 million square kilometres across nine countries in South America, the Amazon is home to millions of species, many of which are found nowhere else on the planet. The rainforest plays a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis. However, the Amazon is under severe threat from deforestation, primarily driven by logging, agriculture, and mining activities. Vast areas of the forest are cleared each year to make way for cattle ranching and soybean farming, both of which are major contributors to the destruction of the rainforest. As trees are cut down, the carbon they store is released into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. In recent years, governments, environmental organizations, and indigenous communities have been working together to combat deforestation and promote sustainable practices. Initiatives such as reforestation projects and stricter regulations on land use aim to preserve the Amazon's biodiversity and its role in combating climate change. Despite these efforts, the future of the Amazon remains uncertain, as economic pressures continue to drive deforestation.
