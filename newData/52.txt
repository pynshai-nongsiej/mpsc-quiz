46. I haven't had fun in ages. I have _________ right now. (Note: This sentence is incomplete or phrased awkwardly for the given options, as the options do not logically complete "I have... right now" to mean "I'm having fun." However, assuming the intent is to say 'I have too much on my plate' meaning I'm busy/stressed/not having fun, or if it's meant to be something like 'I need to let loose right now,' let's check the options. None fit perfectly for 'fun', but for a fill-in-the-blank question, we re-evaluate the question and options. If the intended sentence was "I haven't had fun in ages. I can't have fun right now because I have _________", then 'too much on my plate' would fit. Since we must choose the *correct* option from the provided text, and the preceding sentence is a statement of past lack of fun, the current sentence is expected to relate. Option (C) 'too much on my plate' (meaning too many responsibilities) contrasts with the idea of having fun, which might be the intended meaning for a test-taker's challenge, even if the flow is slightly odd. If the sentence was 'I must have fun right now, I'm going to...', the options still don't fit. Given the constraints, selecting the most likely intended answer in an exam context that often uses contrast/reason is needed. Let's assume the question has a typo and should imply a reason for not having fun, making (C) the most plausible choice.)
(A) two for the price of one
(B) done all in a day's work
(C) too much on my plate
(D) been hit by the weather
Answer: (C) too much on my plate (Plausible only if the sentence structure implied a reason for *not* having fun, e.g., "I can't have fun because I have...") - **Note: There appears to be an error in the question or options for Q46 as written in the source.**

47. After winning the contest, she wouldn't talk to ordinary mortals like us. She now walks with her _________.
(A) head over heels
(B) head in the cloud (Correct idiom is 'head in the clouds')
(C) out of her head
(D) turn up
Answer: (B) head in the cloud (Assuming 'head in the cloud' is a typo for the idiom 'head in the clouds', which means 'to be impractical or to have unrealistic dreams', but in this context, it often means 'to be arrogant/conceited/preoccupied with high ideas' which fits the context of not talking to 'ordinary mortals'.)
