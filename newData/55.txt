*** FULL PASSAGE (SECTION II: Q. 29-33) ***
People project their mental processes into their handwriting. They subconsciously shape and organize their letters, words and lines in ways that directly reflect their personalities. This explains why no two handwritings are-or even can be-alike; the medium is just too personal. Everyday observation confirms the link between handwriting and personality, at least in an elementary way. Precise people construct their words with care, slowly and exactly; dynamic people dash them off. Flamboyant people boldly cover half a page with a few words and a signature, whose size fittingly reflects their expansive sense of self. Most of us have made such observations. But it takes a practiced eye to discern the scores of variations and interpret the subtle interplay of forces at work in any given handwriting. In fact in Europe, handwriting analysis known as graphology, now enjoys scientific acceptance and common use.
