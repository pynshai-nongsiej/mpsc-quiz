Section-III
C. Read the following passage and answer the questions given below following the instructions:

PASSAGE: Asoka made great efforts to teach all his subjects the law of Piety or Duty, to give them an ideal of right living and to ensure justice to all. Accordingly, he drew up a great many edicts, telling people what were their duties and their rights. These edicts were carved on huge pillars and set up so that all people might see them. Many people, however, could not read, so it was laid down that the edicts should be read aloud so many times a year. Thus, even the most ignorant of Asoka's subjects could learn what was expected of him. In one of these edicts Asoka shows his large-hearted love for mankind. "All men are my children," he wrote. He also believed in religious toleration, and instructed his people to respect every man's religion.
