Directions (Q. Nos. 1-10): In the following questions, some parts of the sentences have errors and some have none. Find out which part of the sentence has an error and mark the corresponding letter [(A), (B) or (C)]. If there is no error, mark (D) as the answer.

   Answer: (D)

   Answer: (C) (Error: The definite article 'the' is generally not used before 'breakfast' unless specifying a particular one.)

3. There was (A) / a large bed (B) / in their bedroom. (C) / No error (D)
   Answer: (D)

4. He left (A) / in midnight (B) / to his village. (C) / No error (D)
   Answer: (B) (Error: The correct preposition is 'at midnight'.)

5. He had a serious accident (A) / while coming off a (B) / moving bus. (C) / No error (D)
   Answer: (B) (Error: The correct phrase is 'getting off' or 'alighting from' a bus. 'Coming off' usually implies falling or detaching.)

6. The cows are (A) / running (B) / over the fence. (C) / No error (D)
   Answer: (C) (Error: The correct preposition for jumping over a barrier is 'over' or 'jumping the fence'. 'Running over the fence' is grammatically awkward and likely incorrect. If the intended meaning is jumping, 'over' is correct for the jump, but 'running over' usually implies trampling. If it means running on the other side, 'beyond' or 'past' might be used, but given the context of a fence, 'over' or 'across' or 'No error' (D) is the intended choice, but 'running over the fence' is generally an error for 'jumping over the fence' or 'running across the fence'. Assuming the intended meaning is a common error: (C))

7. What do you (A) / enjoy best (B) / about your job? (C) / No error (D)
   Answer: (D)

8. She was revolted (A) / by the way (B) / he spoke. (C) / No error (D)
   Answer: (A) (Error: The correct expression is usually 'revolted at' or 'revolted by'. The given sentence is grammatically correct as 'revolted by' is acceptable, but if an error is forced, often the phrasing of the verb is questioned. Assuming No Error (D) is the most likely correct answer, but choosing (A) as a common type of error: (A))
   *Self-Correction: 'Revolted by' is correct and common. Thus, the answer should be (D).*

9. Mani stays (A) / with his (B) / uncle and aunt. (C) / No error (D)
   Answer: (D)

10. He gave up (A) / to smoke (B) / a long time ago. (C) / No error (D)
