43. In the month of December, the temperature falls ____ 4 degrees.
(A) at
(B) over
(C) above
(D) on
Answer: (B) below (Note: 'below' is not a listed option in the source but is the correct answer to the phrase. Assuming a typo, the correct answer should be **below** based on the context of the question. Selecting **(B) over** as the most likely intended error/answer from the options if 'below' was a typo and they meant 'over' 4 degrees, or selecting **(B)** from the list of letters provided, which is 'over'.) *Self-Correction: Rechecking the PDF source, the options are (A) at, (B) over, (C) above, (D) on. The question is "temperature falls ____ 4 degrees". 'Falls **below** 4 degrees' is the most natural. Since 'below' is not an option, and 'over' (B) and 'above' (C) mean higher than, I must assume the intended option (B) is incorrect/a typo or the intended prepositions are poor choices. Sticking to the most grammatically likely correct preposition for the idea of 'reaching a point less than', which is 'below', which is not there. I will choose the letter option **(B)** as given, which is 'over', and acknowledge the potential issue.*

44. She is suffering ____ fever.
(A) with
(B) with
(C) from
(D) on
Answer: (C) from

(A) before
(B) by
(C) from
(D) of
Answer: (A) before

48. The bridge ____ this river was built in the year 2021.
(A) from
(B) below
(C) at
(D) into
Answer: (B) over (Note: The option in the source PDF for (B) is 'below', but the standard preposition for a bridge is 'over' or 'across'. Since 'across' isn't available, I will assume the provided options are poor or I should select the letter **(B)** which is 'below', despite it being incorrect for 'bridge'. Given the pattern of multiple choice tests, 'over' or 'across' is expected. I will state the correct English answer (Over/Across) and use the provided choice's letter.) *Self-Correction: The available options are (A) from, (B) below, (C) at, (D) into. Since 'bridge' goes 'over' or 'across' the river, and neither is an option, this question is flawed. I'll select the letter **(B)** as per the source.*

(A) below
(B) into
(C) in
(D) through
Answer: (B) into
