Section-IV
D. Read the following passage and answer the questions given below following the instructions:

Passage:
Floods, earthquakes, droughts, cyclones, tsunamis, etc., are natural disasters. There is no fixed time for these disasters. Thousands of lives are lost and property worth several thousand crores of rupees is destroyed every year. Natural disasters are caused by the forces of nature and are unpredictable. Man has no control over these disasters. Over the years, technological development has enabled man to check some of the natural disasters. Man has created dams to store excess water which can be utilised during times of no rain or drought. Gadgets today can be reliable methods of predicting earthquakes. When disaster strikes it does not discriminate between the rich and poor, classes and masses, and men and women. Everyone is prone to lose everything he or she has. Thousands of people turn destitute within a matter of few minutes. Natural disaster, therefore, is a human problem. People affected by it need all kinds of help from the rest of humanity. But before we can understand how to manage a natural disaster we must know the nature of disaster and the extent of destruction it can cause.
