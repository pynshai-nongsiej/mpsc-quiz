FULL MARKS: 100
Each question carries 2 marks:

Directions: In the following, a sentence/part of the sentence is underlined. Below are given alternatives to the underlined part which may improve the sentence. Choose the correct alternative. In case no improvement is required, choose "No improvement".

1. She told the children not to stop the work.
a) not stopping
b) don't stop
c) not stopping of
d) No improvement
Answer: d) No improvement (The structure "told (someone) not to (verb)" is correct for indirect speech with a negative infinitive.)

2. I am not telling you that you should hunt out people to pursue your policies.
a) asking
b) saying
c) speaking
d) No improvement
Answer: b) saying (In this context, "saying" is a more common and natural alternative to "telling" when simply stating information or opinion, though "telling" is also grammatical. However, since the question asks for alternatives that 'may improve' the sentence, 'saying' is a strong alternative. Given the lack of a clear 'best' choice for improvement among 'asking' and 'speaking', and 'telling' being acceptable, 'saying' is generally preferred in this declarative context.) - **Revising to d) No improvement as 'telling' is perfectly acceptable when the object 'you' is present.**
**Correct Answer: d) No improvement** (The verb 'tell' is appropriate here as it is followed by the direct object 'you'.)

3. He succeeded by dint of hard work.
a) by means of
b) by doing
c) by virtue of
d) No improvement
Answer: d) No improvement ("by dint of" means "by means of/as a result of", so the original sentence is correct and idiomatic.)

4. You have read that book for ages.
a) have been reading
b) had read
c) will be reading
d) No improvement
Answer: a) have been reading (The phrase "for ages" indicates an action that started in the past and continues up to the present, requiring the present perfect continuous tense.)

5. He is resembling his father.
a) has been resembling
b) resembles like
c) resembles
d) No improvement
Answer: c) resembles (The verb 'resemble' is a stative verb and is rarely used in continuous tenses.)

6. It has been two years since I have seen him last.
a) when I have seen him
b) since I had seen him
c) since I saw him
d) No improvement
Answer: c) since I saw him (When "since" introduces a point in time, the simple past tense is used in the 'since' clause. The structure is: It has been (period of time) since (simple past tense).)

7. He told to us everything he knew.
a) us everything he knew
b) us everything he is knowing
c) us everything he was knowing
d) No improvement
Answer: a) us everything he knew (The verb 'told' in this structure is a transitive verb and doesn't require the preposition 'to' before the indirect object 'us'. The correct form is 'He told us everything...')
