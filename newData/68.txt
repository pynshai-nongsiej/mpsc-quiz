*** FULL PASSAGE (SECTION-I) ***
"Time once gone is gone forever." This sentence has encapsulated the true value of time. Time gives only one chance and one has to put all effort and intelligence to make it best usable. Time has no beginning and no ending. All things are born in time, grow in time and then decay and die in time. Time moves at its own pace. It cannot be commanded. It does not wait for kings or princes and has no pity for beggars. It cannot be analyzed. It can not be criticised. We are generally conscious about passing time and its importance. We have developed clocks and watches to indicate its flow. We have invented dates, days and years to indicate and measure it in our own way, but mind me, it is really indivisible and immeasurable. People say time is money. But I am saying that it is more precious than money. Money lost can be recovered, but not the time lost. A moment lost is lost forever. Time is ever changing. We should never postpone doing good and important things. We should never be idle when we ought to be working hard. Leisure is enjoyable only after fruitful hard work. It is our duty to not to leave any work till tomorrow that can be done today and now. We should not waste time. Actually, nobody can waste time. It is we who are being wasted by time. Economy and value of time is very much important. Great men and women use their every moment most profitably and economically. It is through this method that they have invented great things, discovered wonderful things and left their footprints on the sands of time. Even our spare time should be wisely used. It should be utilized in pursuit of healthy and meaningful hobbies and ecstasy. We may study books, learn music, play with children, grow a garden, learn to do something new and useful in our leisure. To value time is to value the divine.
