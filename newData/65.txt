*** Section-III: READING COMPREHENSION (Q. Nos. 36-40) ***

*** FULL PASSAGE ***
There is no reason to believe that there are fundamental differences between the East and the West. Human beings are basically the same everywhere. The differences, which undoubtedly are significant, are related to external, social conditions. East and West are relative terms. They are geographical expressions and not cultural types. The differences among countries like China, India, and Japan are quite as significant as those among European or American Countries. These differences are of specific cultural patterns with distinctive beliefs and habits developed in different regions in relative isolation from one another. There were periods when China and India were preeminent in cultural affairs, others when Western nations aided by scientific developments have dominated the East. The world has now reached a stage of intercommunication. All societies are fast becoming industrialised and new sets of values are springing up. If we are to live together in peace we must develop international cooperation and understanding.
