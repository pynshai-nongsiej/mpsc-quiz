55. The book **were** (a) / so interesting (b)/that I could not put it down (c)/No error (d)
Error in (a). Subject is singular ("book"), verb should be singular ("**was**").

56. I told him **as forceful as possible** (a) / that he could not (b)/ enter the room (c)/No error (d)
Error in (a). "forceful" (adjective) must be replaced by the adverb "**forcefully**" to modify the verb "told".

Error in (b). Should be "**not** going on vacation".

58. There is (a) / **not** butter (b)/ in the refrigerator (c) / No error (d)

59. I encourage you (a) / to **do not** (b) / wait for him (c)/No error (d)
Error in (b). Should be "**not to** wait" (The 'not' should precede the 'to' in the infinitive phrase).

60. He gave me **so good advice** (a) / that I was (b)/ very grateful to him (c)/No error (d)
Error in (a). Should be "**such good advice**" (Use 'such a/an' + adjective + singular countable noun, or 'such' + adjective + uncountable/plural noun).

61. He was **as rich** (a) / **that** he (b) / owned four homes (c)/No error (d)
Error in (b). Should be "**so rich that** he owned..." (The structure is "so... that...").

62. We went (a) / to the store (b)/ and bought **an new stove** (c) / No error (d)

No error (d)

64. Everyone should have (a) / an equal opportunity (b)/ to get good **education** (c)/No error (d)
Error in (c). The noun "education" is generally uncountable and does not take an article here. Should be "**to get good education**". (The article 'a' is often omitted when speaking about education in general).

65. The professor (a) / forbids the students (b) / **learning** early (c) / No error (d)
Error in (c). The correct construction is "forbid someone **to do** something." Should be "**to leave** early" or "**to learn** early" (assuming 'leaving' was intended). Since 'learning' is nonsensical in the context, and verbs like 'forbid' typically use the infinitive structure, the error is in the form of the verb.

66. I am looking **forwards** (a) / to seeing (b)/ you again (c)/No error (d)
Error in (a). The fixed idiom is "looking **forward** to," without the 's'.

No error (d)

69. The children (a) / went to the movies (b)/ without **no** money (c) / No error (d)

Error in (b). Should be "**no longer**". (Identical error to Q.51)
