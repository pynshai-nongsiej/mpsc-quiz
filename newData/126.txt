**FULL PASSAGE:**
There are some people who speak slightingly of hobbies as if they were something childish and frivolous. But, a man without a hobby is like a ship without a rudder. Life is such a tumultuous affair that most of us get lost and reach the end of the journey without ever having found a direction. A hobby may be entirely trivial but it supplies what the mind needs, an outlet for disinterested enthusiasm outside the routine of work and play. It has a way of opening up new aspects you begin with stamps and find you are thinking in continents; you may collect coins and find that the history of man is written on them. Every worthwhile hobby leads out into the universe. It saves us from the humiliation of only knowing things superficially. No man who knows one subject well will ever be regarded as a fool. A hobby is a refuge from the strange chaos of life with its problems, losses and disappointments, a refuge where we can find things that we can grasp and understand without fear of bereavement or illusion.
