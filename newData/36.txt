Directions (Q. Nos. 1-5): In the following questions, a sentence has three parts [(A), (B) and (C)). Find out which part of the sentence has an error and choose the option corresponding to it. If the sentence is free from error, choose (D) as your answer.

1. In today's modern age with / (A) technological advances, the opportunity / (B) to learn is seemingly everywhere. / (C) No error (D)
   Answer: (A) (The error is redundancy; 'today's modern age' should likely be 'today's age' or 'the modern age'.)

2. Either he is / (A) a complete fool or / (B) he had lost his mind. / (C) No error (D)
   Answer: (C) (The tense is inconsistent; 'he had lost' should be 'he has lost' or 'he lost' to maintain parallelism with 'he is'.)

   Answer: (D) (The sentence is grammatically correct.)

4. She completed her / (A) assignment an went / (B) out for a walk. / (C) No error (D)

5. She had a courage / (A) to raise her voice / (B) against injustice. / (C) No error (D)
   Answer: (A) (The article 'a' is incorrect; 'courage' is an uncountable noun here, so it should be 'She had courage' or 'She had the courage'.)

Directions (Q. Nos. 11-15): Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow.

PASSAGE:
In the past, man's worst enemy was Nature. He lived under the continual threat of famine and pestilence, a wet summer could bring death to a whole nation and every winter was a menace. Mountains stood like a barrier between people and people, a sea was less a highway than an impassable division. Today Nature, though still an enemy, is an enemy almost completely conquered. Modern agriculture assures us of ample food supply. Modern transportation has made the resources of the entire planet accessible to all its inhabitants. Modern medicine and sanitation allow dense populations to cover the ground without risk of pestilence. True, we are still at the mercy of the more violent natural convulsions. Against earthquake, flood and hurricane, man has, as yet, devised no adequate protection. At most times, Nature is no longer formidable, she has been subdued.

11. Modern medicine has helped man to
    (A) live longer everywhere in the world
    (B) live a healthy life in hygienic conditions
    (C) live in thickly populated areas without fear of epidemic
    (D) balance population with available resources
    Answer: (C) (The passage states: "Modern medicine and sanitation allow dense populations to cover the ground without risk of pestilence.")

12. Man has yet succeeded in controlling the furies of
    (A) earthquakes
    (B) floods
    (C) hurricanes
    (D) All of the above
    Answer: (D) (The question asks which furies he *has yet succeeded in controlling*. The passage states that man has devised *no adequate protection* against earthquake, flood, and hurricane. Therefore, the intended answer must be that he has *not* succeeded in controlling these, but given the structure of the question, it's likely a misphrased question or a typo, and the intended question was "Man has yet *not* succeeded in controlling..." or "Against which furies has man devised no adequate protection?" Based on the options, and the context that he *hasn't* succeeded, but all options are natural furies, there is a contradiction. Assuming the question means which of these has he *not* yet controlled: All of the above.)

13. Which one of the following statements best reflects the underlying conviction of the passage?
    (A) Man can do wonders.
    (B) Man's knowledge has no end.
    (C) Man has been able to control Nature to a great extent.
    (D) Man has been able to control Nature completely.
    Answer: (C) (The passage says Nature is "almost completely conquered" and "has been subdued," but also that we are "still at the mercy of the more violent natural convulsions," indicating control to a great extent, but not completely.)

14. In ancient times, man has an apprehension of
    (A) epidemics
    (B) severe droughts
    (C) floods
    (D) All of the above
    Answer: (D) (The passage mentions "famine" (related to drought/lack of food) and "pestilence" (epidemics) as continual threats, and later lists "flood" as a still-unconquered fury, implying it was a threat in the past as well. Thus, "All of the above" is the most comprehensive answer.)

15. The modern transport system is a blessing as it
    (A) has helped decrease the distance between towns and villages
    (B) has brought comfort to both towns and villages
    (C) has made all the commodities available to everyone
    (D) has encouraged people to travel for pleasure
    Answer: (C) (The passage states: "Modern transportation has made the resources of the entire planet accessible to all its inhabitants.")
