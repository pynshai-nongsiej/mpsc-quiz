Passage:
No matter how advanced civilization becomes, one of life's greatest mysteries remains unsolved-the vanishing socks. You put two socks in the laundry, yet somehow, only one emerges victorious. Where does its twin go? Some say there's an alternate dimension filled exclusively with lost socks, while others believe washing machines secretly consume one sock per cycle as part of an ancient mechanical ritual. Scientists have proposed several theories, but none have fully explained this bizarre phenomenon. One popular theory suggests that static electricity makes socks cling to other clothes, leading to their unnoticed escape. Others claim that mischievous pets or house elves may be the true culprits. Whatever the truth may be, the missing sock saga continues, leaving humans worldwide bewildered and forever searching for the elusive half of their favourite pair.
