SECTION 3: READING COMPREHENSION AND SYNONYMS

Directions (Q. Nos. 21-25): Read the passage given below and answer the questions following the instruction.

PASSAGE:
Roots of each civilization are several centuries old. Then there is an action and interaction between different cultures, such that no culture can be claimed to be absolutely pure and pristine. This also leads to conflicts because some groups abhor outside influence. Then they isolate themselves which leads to their cultural stagnation. Culture, to be of any value, must have certain depth and dynamism. Among the factors which have influenced culture are geography, climate, etc. This is the case with the Arabian culture. The Indian culture is influenced by the Himalayas, the forests and the great rivers of India. Various aspects of culture like architecture, music and literature, often mix together. The worst thing for a culture is the deliberate shutting up of mind to other influences. In the opinion of J. L. Nehru, "... the growth and decline of India in history can be measured from the amount of India's capacity to accept or, reject outside influences during different periods in history."

Choose the appropriate synonyms of the following.

21. Roots
(A) structure
(B) ancestry
(C) foundation
(D) hereditary
Answer: (C) foundation

22. Abhor
(A) detest
(B) adore
(C) gather
(D) organize
Answer: (A) detest

23. Stagnation
(A) development
(B) movement
(C) recession
(D) direction
Answer: (C) recession (Though 'lack of development/activity' is more direct, 'recession' (a period of decline or reduced activity) is the closest synonym provided.)

24. Deliberate
(A) hasty
(B) spontaneous
(C) haphazard
(D) calculated
Answer: (D) calculated

25. Decline
(A) accept
(B) reject
(C) approve
(D) ascent
Answer: (D) ascent (Wait, 'ascent' is the opposite/antonym of 'decline'. The instruction is to choose the **synonym**. Since 'decline' is used as a noun/verb meaning 'a falling off/deterioration' and no true synonym is listed, I will assume a potential error in the question or options. However, if the question meant **antonym**, the answer is (D) ascent. Sticking strictly to the provided options for a **synonym**, none is an accurate choice. Since a choice must be made, and given the context of 'growth and decline', none of the options A, B, C, D are strong synonyms. I will list a common interpretation where a test may have intended an antonym: **Answer: (D) ascent** (Assuming the question intended 'antonym' instead of 'synonym'.)
