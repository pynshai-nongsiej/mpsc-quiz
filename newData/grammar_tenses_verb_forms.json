      "answer": "B (Or \"has sold\", but option B \"sells\" is the only grammatically viable simple verb, though Present Perfect \"has sold\" would be ideal. Given options, if \"sells\" is the only finite verb, it might be the choice, but standard grammar demands Present Perfect. Wait, looking at options for Q39: a) sell, b) sells, c) sold, d) selling. None is Present Perfect. \"Sold\" is simple past. \"Sells\" is present. Let's look at Q42. Q42 has \"has had\". Q39 might be \"sold\" if the timeline is narrative. Let's re-evaluate Q39 options provided in image. The image says: \"He ____ over fifty pictures since then.\" Options: a) sell, b) sells, c) sold, d) selling. \"Sold\" is likely expected here as a past narrative, even though \"since\" usually triggers perfect tense. However, \"has sold\" is not an option. \"Sold\" is the best fit among bad options).  C (Best available option)."
