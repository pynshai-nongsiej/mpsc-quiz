PASSAGE:
I was seven-year-old. I had lived at the same place for all of my life, but we were moving. We were moving from the farm with all of its animals, with its memories of searching for chicken eggs, and with the black and white cows that had to be milked each day. We were going from the place of scrub pines, of pastures, of irrigation ditches to an unknown, unknowable place, far, far away. We had worked hard to get ready. Finally, dad piled all of us into the car. As we began to drive away, I looked out of the rear window of the car. As I looked back, I saw my dog, and my cats. I could not see my horse. I asked my father what would happen to these pets. All that dad could tell me was that they had to remain there, that they could not come with us. There was no explanation-merely the declaration that we must go. I was bitterly disappointed, so disappointed that this memory is still seared into me, forty-three years later. Why could my father not change this? I could not understand then, but I do now. But still don't understand why there was no explanation.

(A) is it?
(B) aren't we?
(C) shouldn't we?

39. Bees produce sweet honey as its sting is deadly.
(A) but
(B) for
(C) and
(D) No error
Answer: (A) but (The two clauses show a contrast, thus requiring a contrastive conjunction like 'but'. Also, the pronoun should be 'their' for 'Bees' or 'a bee' for 'its', but 'but' addresses the error in conjunction usage.)

40. I am tired as I am working since 7 o'clock in the morning.
(A) I was working
(B) I have been working
(C) I had been working
(D) No error
Answer: (B) I have been working (The phrase 'since 7 o'clock' requires a perfect continuous tense, in this context the present perfect continuous to show an action started in the past and continuing up to the present.)

(A) ordered her teacher
(B) said to her teacher
(C) asked her teacher
(D) No error

42. I have wrote a letter to her.
(A) write
(B) written
(C) will write
(D) No error
Answer: (B) written (The auxiliary verb 'have' requires the past participle form of the main verb, which is 'written'.)

43. She has been plucks flowers since morning.
(A) pluck
(B) pick
(C) plucking
(D) No error
Answer: (C) plucking (The structure 'has been' requires the present participle (V-ing) for the Present Perfect Continuous tense.)

Directions (Q. Nos. 51-58): In each of the following questions, a sentence is given in Direct/Indirect speech. Out of the four alternatives suggested, choose the one which best expresses the same sentence in Indirect/Direct speech. Mark the correct answer in your Answer Sheet.

51. The man exclaimed that his wallet was stolen. (Indirect)
(A) "My wallet was stolen !" the man said.
(B) "Somebody stole my wallet !" exclaimed the man.
(C) The man exclaimed, "My wallet was stolen !"
(D) The man cried, "My wallet was stolen."
Answer: (C) The man exclaimed, "My wallet was stolen !" (The original sentence is a simple past tense assertion that converts to a past tense exclamation in Direct speech.)

52. Rima said to Priya, "Why are you sketching on the wall?" (Direct)
(A) Rima asked Priya why was she sketching on the wall.
(B) Rima asked Priya why had she been sketching on the wall.
(C) Rima asked Priya that why is she sketching on the wall.
(D) Rima asked Priya why she was sketching on the wall.
Answer: (D) Rima asked Priya why she was sketching on the wall. (In Indirect Speech for a question, 'said to' changes to 'asked', the question word 'why' is used as the conjunction, the verb tense changes from Present Continuous 'are sketching' to Past Continuous 'was sketching', and the subject-verb order changes from question form to statement form.)

53. "Stand at ease", the soldier said to his men. (Direct)
(A) The soldier told his men that they should stand at ease.
(B) The soldier said to his men that they should stand at ease.
(C) The soldier urged his men to stand at ease.
(D) The soldier commanded his men to stand at ease.
Answer: (D) The soldier commanded his men to stand at ease. (An imperative/order from a soldier to his men is best reported with 'commanded' followed by the infinitive 'to stand'.)

54. Mr. Swer asked the lady if she could tell him where the nearest post office is. (Indirect)
(A) "Where is the nearest post office?" Mr. Swer asked the lady.
(B) Mr. Swer asked the lady, "Could you tell me where the nearest post office is?"
(C) Mr. Swer asked the lady, "Where is the nearest post office?"
(D) Mr. Swer said to the lady, "Where is the nearest post office?"
Answer: (B) Mr. Swer asked the lady, "Could you tell me where the nearest post office is?" (The indirect speech uses 'if she could tell him where the nearest post office is', which is the indirect form of the polite direct question in option B. Note: In the indirect speech given, 'is' should technically be 'was', but option B is the most structurally accurate direct speech from the choices.)

55. The Professor said that nobody could solve the problem. (Indirect)
(A) The Professor said, "Nobody can solve the problem."
(B) The Professor said, "Nobody could solve the problem."
(C) The Professor exclaimed, "Nobody could solve the problem."
(D) The Professor exclaimed, "Nobody can solve the problem."
Answer: (B) The Professor said, "Nobody could solve the problem." ('Could' usually remains 'could' in indirect speech, or sometimes changes from 'can' in direct speech. Since the reporting verb is 'said' and not 'exclaimed', option B is the best fit, as 'could' can also be a modal for possibility/ability which remains unchanged.)

56. Seeta said to me, "Can you give me your pen?" (Direct)
(A) Seeta asked me can I give her my pen.
(B) Seeta asked me if I can give me your pen.
(C) Seeta asked me if I could give her my pen.
(D) Seeta asked me if I could give me your pen.
Answer: (C) Seeta asked me if I could give her my pen. (The question is reported with 'asked me', 'if' is used, 'can' changes to 'could', 'you' changes to 'I', and 'me' changes to 'her', and 'your' changes to 'my'.)

57. The father warned his son that he should beware of the pickpocket. (Indirect)
(A) The father warned his son, "Beware of the pickpocket !"
(B) The father warned his son, "Watch that chap!"
(C) The father warned his son, "Be careful about the pickpocket."
(D) The father warned his son, "Don't fall into the trap."
Answer: (A) The father warned his son, "Beware of the pickpocket !" (An imperative sentence expressing a warning is converted to indirect speech using 'warned' + infinitive. The word 'beware' directly corresponds to the meaning of the indirect sentence.)

58. "What about going for a swim?" he said, "It's quite fine now." (Direct)
(A) He asked me about going for a swim as it was quite fine then.
(B) He proposed going for a swim as it was quite fine.
(C) He suggested going for a swim as it was quite fine.
(D) He advised me to go for a swim as it was quite fine.
Answer: (C) He suggested going for a swim as it was quite fine. ('What about V-ing' is a form of suggestion, best reported with 'suggested V-ing'. The time word 'now' should change to 'then' for strict correctness but is omitted in option C and B, and C is stylistically better for the suggestion.)
