Directions (Q. Nos. 1-4): Read the following passage and answer the questions by selecting the answer choice from the alternatives given.

Passage:
"A principal fruit of friendship," Francis Bacon wrote in his timeless meditation on the subject, "is the ease and discharge of the fullness and swellings of the heart, which passions of all kinds do cause and induce." For Thoreau, friendship was one of life's great rewards. But in today's cultural landscape of muddled relationships scattered across various platforms for connecting, amidst constant debates about whether our Facebook 'friendships' are making us more or less happy, it pays to consider what friendship actually is. That's precisely what CUNY philosophy professor Massimo Pigliucci explores in his book titled, Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to A More Meaningful Life, which also gave us this provocative read on the science of what we call 'intuition'. Philosophers and cognitive scientists agree that friendship is an essential ingredient of human happiness. But beyond the dry academic definitions-like, say, "voluntary interdependence between two persons over time, which is intended to facilitate socio-emotional goals of the participants, and may involve varying types and degrees of companionship, intimacy, affection and mutual assistance"-lies a body of compelling research that sheds light on how, precisely, friendship augments happiness. The way friendship enhances well-being, it turns out, has nothing to do with quantity and everything to do with quality-researchers confirm that it isn't the number of friends (or, in the case of Facebook, 'friends').
