a) A
b) B
c) C (Answer)
d) D

12. Tina and John was (A) / working as usual (B) / even on a Sunday (C) / No error (D).

c) C
d) D

13. The table is so very heavy (A) / that Anwar (B) / could hardly carry it upstairs (C) / No error (D).

14. Jane cannot remember (A) / where she did leave (B) / her glasses (C) / No error (D).

15. The novel Pride and Prejudice (A) / are being written (B) / by Jane Austen (C) / No error (D).
*Error: (B). 'Pride and Prejudice' is a single novel title (singular subject), so 'are' should be 'is'. Also, "is being written" is Present Continuous Passive, which is inappropriate for a completed work; the correct tense would be "was written" or "has been written" if referring to the completion, or "is a novel written" if referring to its state, but given the options and focus on verb-subject agreement, the primary error is 'are' for 'is'.*
a) A
b) B (Answer)
c) C
d) D

16. The bill for the food (A) / is amounted (B) / to two thousand rupees (C) / No error (D).

c) C
d) D

b) B
c) C
d) D (Answer)

18. The whole class (A) / decide to collect (B) / an emergency for the flood victims (C) / No error (D).
*Error: (B). 'decide' should be 'decided' for past tense consistency, or 'decides' if 'class' is treated as a singular unit and the action is habitual/current. Since 'decide' is present tense simple form for a singular subject, and the action seems completed, the error is in the verb form.*
a) A
b) B (Answer)
c) C
d) D

19. This company (A) / is one of the (B)/worlds trusted company (C) / No error (D).
*Error: (C). After 'one of the', the noun must be plural: "worlds trusted companies". Also, 'worlds' should be 'world's' (possessive) or 'world's most trusted' to be idiomatic.*
a) A
b) B
c) C (Answer)
d) D

20. The hotel room (A) / we visited (B) / were dinghy ans gloomy (C) / No error (D).
