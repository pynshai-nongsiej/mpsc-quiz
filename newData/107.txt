Directions: In the following questions, some of the sentences have errors and some have none. Find out which part of the sentence has an error. If there is no mistake, the answer is 'No error.'

1. No sooner (a) / had he said it when he realised (b)/his folly (c) / no error (d).
Answer: (b) (Error: The correct conjunction pair with 'No sooner' is 'than', not 'when'. It should be "No sooner had he said it **than** he realised...")

2. Yesterday Mark got the (a) / information that his father (b) / died of accident (c) / no error (d).
Answer: (c) (Error: The correct preposition is 'in' or 'by' not 'of'. It should be "died **in** an accident" or "died **by** accident".)

3. Though he was (a) / highly educated (b) / but he was very modest (c) / no error (d).
Answer: (c) (Error: The conjunction 'though' or 'although' cannot be followed by 'but'. It should be "Though he was highly educated, he was very modest.")

4. A man jumped (a) / in the river (b) / in a state of depression (c) / no error (d).
Answer: (b) (Error: The preposition 'in' indicates position inside. 'Jumped' indicates movement, so 'into' is correct. It should be "A man jumped **into** the river".)

5. He came (a) / from abroad (b) / for seeing me (c) / no error (d).
Answer: (c) (Error: The correct structure for purpose is 'to see'. It should be "He came from abroad **to see** me.")

Answer: (a) (Error: The structure 'so + adjective + noun' should be replaced by 'such a + adjective + noun'. It should be "It was **such a lovely weather**...")

7. Jack was living in Dover (a) / for five years (b) / before the year 2020 (c) / no error (d).
Answer: (a) (Error: For an action continuing up to a past time ('before the year 2020'), the Past Perfect Continuous tense should be used. It should be "Jack **had been living** in Dover".)

8. Us (a) / may stay (b) / in Darjeeling until the monsoon starts (c) / no error (d).
Answer: (a) (Error: The subject of the sentence must be in the nominative case, not the objective case. It should be "**We** may stay...")

9. The road (a) / to famous movement (b) / passes through a forest (c) / no error (d).
Answer: (b) (Error: A specific famous monument requires the definite article 'the'. It should be "to **the** famous movement/monument". Assuming 'movement' is a typo for 'monument'.)
