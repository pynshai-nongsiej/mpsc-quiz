'Which' is generally used for animals/things, but the question is flawed. If we assume the most likely answer based on general English structure, we should consider it incomplete or select the most neutral pronoun.

a) (i) and (ii)
b) (i) and (iii)
c) (ii) and (iii)
d) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Answer: (B) (i) and (iii) (Assuming 'committe' is a singular collective noun, (i) uses the incorrect verb 'get' instead of the past participle 'got' or 'gotten'. However, if (i) is intended to be 'Hasn't the women's committee gotten the prizes yet?', the options are confusing. Comparing (ii) and (iii): (ii) uses 'Haven't' (plural verb) and (iii) uses 'Hasn't' (singular verb). Assuming the collective noun 'committe'/'committee' is singular, (iii) is the correct structure. Since (i) and (iii) are identical in the PDF, and (ii) uses the wrong verb form, the correct answer is (B) with the caveat that 'get' is incorrect, but the sentences are structurally identical with 'Hasn't'.)
Answer: (C) (ii) and (iii) (The sentences in the options are highly confusing. The safest is to assume the question is flawed and select the most common structure for a collective noun: 'committee' can be singular ('Hasn't') or plural ('Haven't'). Sentence (i) is wrong because it uses 'get' after 'Hasn't'. Sentence (iii) is correct if the committee is singular. Sentence (ii) is correct if the committee is plural. Given the identical wording of (i) and (iii) in the file, we assume the correct sentences are (ii) and (iii) as they represent the two acceptable forms, if 'committe' is assumed to mean 'committee'.)

a) (i) and (ii)
b) (i) and (iii)
c) (ii) and (iii)
d) (i), (ii) and (iii)

Section-IV
D. Read the following passage and answer the questions given below following the instructions:

**Passage:**
Floods, earthquakes, droughts, cyclones, tsunamis etc are natural disasters. There is no fixed time for these disasters. Thousands of lives are lost and property worth several thousand crores of rupees is destroyed on account of these natural disasters every year. Natural disasters are caused by the forces of nature and are unpredictable. Man has no control over these disasters. Over the years, technological development has enabled man to check some of the natural disasters. Man has created dams to store excess water during rains and thus, check floods. The excess water collected in the dams can be utilised during the times of no rain or drought. Cyclones today can be predicted beforehand. But there is no reliable method of predicting the earthquakes. When disaster strikes it does not discriminate between rich and poor, classes and masses, and men and women. Everyone is prone to lose everything he or she has. Thousands of people turn destitute within a matter of few minutes. Natural disaster, therefore, is a human problem. People affected by it need all kinds of help from the rest of the humanity. But before we can understand how to manage a natural disaster we must know the nature of disaster and the extent of destruction it can cause.
