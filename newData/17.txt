READING COMPREHENSION PASSAGE (Q. Nos. 11-20)

Willard Gibbs was a gentle spirit whose life was spent in his laboratory at Yale University, and who never dreamed that his work in mathematical physics might have even a remote relationship to war; and yet it is safe to say that his ideas gave added power to the armaments of all nations in both World War I and World War II. I suspect that the way out of the dilemma is not as simple as the questions now being asked seem to imply. The good and the evil that flow from scientific research are more often than not indistinguishable at the point of origin. Generally they are by-products, or they represent distortions of original purpose, none of which could have been foreseen when the initial discovery was made. We are driven back to a question of human motives and desires. Science has recently given us radar, jet propulsion and power sources of unprecedented magnitude. What does society want to do with them? It can use them constructively to increase the happiness of mankind or it can employ them to tear the world to pieces. There is scarcely a scientific formula or a process or a commodity which cannot be used for war purposes, if that is what we elect to do with it. In brief, the gifts of science can be used by evil men to do evil even more obviously and dramatically than they can be used by men of goodwill to do good. I fear there is no easy way out of our dilemma. I would not absolve the scientists from some measures of responsibility, for they are men of superior training and insight and we are entitled to look to them for help and leadership-more help and leadership, I venture to add, than have thus far been given. However, I note that a considerable number of scientists who were connected with the atomic bomb project have publicly expressed their apprehension of the consequences of their own creation. "All of us who worked on the atomic bomb", said Dr. Allison of the University of Chicago, "had a momentary feeling of elation when our experiment met with success; but that feeling rapidly changed to a feeling of horror, and a fervent desire that no more bombs would be dropped." Nevertheless, in the long run I do not believe that we shall be successful in making science the arbiter of its discoveries. Somehow or other society itself must assume that responsibility. The towering enemy of mankind is not science but war. Science merely reflects the social forces by which it is surrounded. When there is peace, science is constructive; when there is war, science is perverted to destructive ends. The weapons which science gives us do not necessarily create war; they make war increasingly more terrible, until now it has brought us to the doorstep of doom.
