READING COMPREHENSION PASSAGE

Directions: Read the following passage and answer the questions by selecting the answer choice from the alternatives given. 

**PASSAGE TEXT:**
"Who doesn't know how to cook rice? Cooking rice hardly takes time," said my father. So, I challenged myself.  I switched from news to YouTube and typed. "How to cook rice?" I took one and a half cups of rice.  Since I didn't have access to a rice cooker, I put the rice in a big pot.  Firstly, the rice has to be washed to get rid of dust and starch. I thought I won't be able to drain the rice and that it will fall out of the pot. I observed the chef as I swirled the rice around and used my dexterous hands to drain it, not once, not twice, but three times.  I looked down at the sink and saw less than 50 grains that made their way out of the pot. 56] Suffice to say, I was up to the mark. The video stated that the key to perfect rice is equal amounts of rice and water.  I have heard that professionals don't need to measure everything; they just know what the right amount is.  But as this was my first time in the kitchen, I decided to experiment by not measuring the water needed for boiling the rice.  I wanted the rice to be firm when bitten, just like pasta. I don't enjoy the texture of mushy rice.It has to have that chutzpah—it has to resist my biting power just for a bit before disintegrating. After what seemed like 10 minutes, all the water disappeared. I went in to give it a good stir. To my surprise, some of the rice got stuck to the pot. I tried to scrape it off but to no avail.  At the same time, there was a burning smell coming from it. I quickly turned the stove off. "What have you done to the kitchen?" My mother shouted while coming towards the kitchen. I managed to ward her off.Finally, when the time came to taste my creation. I was surprised! It wasn't bad at all.  The rice had the desired consistency. Sure, a little more salt would've been better, but I just added that while eating.  The experience was fairly rewarding and memorable. It taught me a new sense of respect for those who cook food on a regular basis at home or are engaged in gourmet creations professionally.

9. The father's question to the narrator, about knowing how to cook rice, was intended to 72]

SENTENCE CORRECTION (IDENTIFYING ERRORS)

Directions: In the following questions, some sentences have errors and some do not. The underlined words are the key words where you can identify whether the sentence is erroneous or not. From the given set of choices, choose the correct alternative for the identified errors. Where there is no error, choose the specified option (d).

29. After the summer break, school will open **after** two weeks. 
    a) Begin 
    b) Reopen 
    c) Start
    d) No errors 
    **Answer: b) Reopen** (The most natural and common word after a break, replacing 'open after' which is awkward. The error is likely in the word "open," which should be "reopen." If the error is only in the second "after," which is an awkward repetition, then 'No errors' is the intended answer if the original word 'open' is accepted, but 'Reopen' is the best structural fix for the flow.)
    *(Assuming 'open after' is an error, a simple correction is difficult. If the underlined word is 'open', **Reopen** is the best alternative. If the sentence is fine as written, then **No errors**.* *Selecting **b) Reopen** as the best fit for the context.)*
