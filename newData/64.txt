Directions: (Q.No. 36-40) In these questions, some of the sentences have errors and some have none. Find out which part of a sentence a, b, c, d has an error and select that part as an answer. If there is no error, then (D) is the answer.

36. On behalf of the company (a)/ and myself (b) / I want to thank all of you for your support (c)/No error (d)
Error is in part (b). "myself" should be the subject pronoun "I" in a compound subject, or the objective pronoun "me" if the sentence structure were different. The correct phrase should be "On behalf of the company and **I**" or more formally, "On behalf of the company and **me**" (though "I" is commonly used). However, the pronoun is incorrect for the subject position when listed last. The correct formal construction for the object of the preposition "of" would be "On behalf of the company and **me**," but since it is functioning as the subject of the clause "I want to thank...", the most common error to correct here is the use of the reflexive pronoun. The corrected structure would likely be: "On behalf of the company (a)/ and **I** (b) / want to thank all of you for your support (c)". *Self-correction: The phrase "On behalf of X and Y" means X and Y are the ones doing the thanking. Since 'I' is the subject of 'want to thank', the parallel structure should be used. The construction 'On behalf of the company and myself' is often considered ungrammatical. The error is in **(b)**.

37. I will (a)/ call on you (b)/ before I leave (c)/No error (d)
No error (d) - All parts are grammatically correct.

38. He called me (a) / as (b) / a fool (c) / No error (d)
Error is in part (b). The word "as" is redundant when using the verb "called" in this context. It should be "He called me a fool." Error is in **(b)**.

39. This is the House (a)/ Jack (b)/ was born in (c)/No error (d)
No error (d) - All parts are grammatically correct, though "This is the house in which Jack was born" is more formal.

40. She was (a)/ died a couple (b) / of years ago (c) / No error (d)
Error is in part (a) or (b). The verb "to die" is not used in the passive voice with "was" in this context. It should be "She **died** a couple of years ago." The error is in **(a)** or **(b)**, depending on how the parts are split, but "was died" is the ungrammatical phrase. Let's select **(a)** as the error is the incorrect verb form "was".
