SRQP. Since SRQP is not an option, and RQSP (a small silver elephant stood upon a shelf) is the best fit for an option, selecting (C).

(B) Last night in the concert beautifully at U Soso Tham Auditorium. (C) Beautifully at U Soso Tham Auditorium last night in the concert.

20. My Aunt
shuts out the world who (P)
by closing her eyes (R)
is a loner (S)
(A) SPQR
(B) QSPR (Missing Q in parts) - Assuming the parts are P, R, S.
(C) SQRP
(D) RPQS
Assuming the sentence should be: My Aunt who is a loner shuts out the world by closing her eyes. (S P R)
Let's re-examine the parts. The question structure is incomplete without a Q. Based on the options and available parts P, R, S:
(A) S P Q R: is a loner shuts out the world who (Q missing) by closing her eyes.
(C) S Q R P: is a loner (Q missing) by closing her eyes shuts out the world who.
(D) R P Q S: by closing her eyes shuts out the world who (Q missing) is a loner.
If we assume the main clause is "My Aunt" and the relative clause is "who is a loner," and the action is "shuts out the world by closing her eyes," the sequence is **S P R**. Since S P R is not an option, and assuming **Q** is the verb phrase that follows 'My Aunt' (like 'who is'), the options are impossible to decipher. Sticking to the most likely sentence structure using P, R, S: S P R. None of the options are S P R. Option (A) SPQR and (C) SQRP and (D) RPQS are given. If Q is meant to be the start of the predicate, such as 'is a woman who', let's assume Q is missing and try the others based on S P R being the required sequence:
(A) SPQR: S-P-R is the core of the sentence.
(C) SQRP: S-R-P is the core.
(D) RPQS: R-P-S is the core.
Based on the best English sentence construction: "My Aunt who is a loner shuts out the world by closing her eyes." The sequence is S P R. Given the options, let's assume the question is flawed and skip it or select the one with the most potential components in order: S P (A).
Answer: (A) SPQR (Assuming a flaw in the question parts/options and S P R is the intended structure)
