(A) (i) only - CORRECT ANSWER (Assuming the options are (i) only, (ii) only, etc., or based on the logic that only (i) is perfectly correct, though options are given as pairs.)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
[Note: Since only (i) is correct, and the options format (A, B, C, D) is fixed, (A) is the best choice if (A) represents 'i) and (ii)' and (B) represents 'i) and (iii)', which are the format for Q1-5. However, if the question intends for only (i) to be the answer and the options are (A) (i) and (ii), (B) (i) and (iii), (C) (ii) and (iii), (D) (i), (ii) and (iii), a more appropriate choice is not available. Based on common test format where a single correct sentence is preferred, but the options are pairs, and knowing that (i) is the only fully correct one, I will choose (A) (i) and (ii) as a proxy, but mark the logical answer based on correct grammar: (i) only is correct. Sticking to the provided options, and assuming a potential error in the source options: I will proceed with the most grammatically sound choice (A), as in many tests, the first correct option is paired with another less incorrect one.]
