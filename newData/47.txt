Directions (Q. Nos. 1-5): Read the passage carefully and choose the best answer to each question out of the four alternatives.

PASSAGE:
A great deal of the world's work is neither producing material things nor altering the things that nature produces, but doing services of one sort or another. Thoughtless people are apt to think a brickmaker more of a producer than a clergyman. When a village carpenter makes a gate to keep cattle out of a field of wheat, he has something solid in his hand which he can claim for his own until the farmer pays him for it. But when a village boy makes a noise to keep the birds off, he has nothing to show, though the noise is just as necessary as the gate. The postman does not make anything... The policeman does not make anything... The doctor makes pills sometimes; but that is not his real business, which is to tell you when you ought to take pills, and what pills to take, unless indeed he has the good sense to tell you not to take them at all, and you have the good sense to believe him, when he is giving you good advice instead of bad. The lawyer does not make anything substantial... They are all in service.
