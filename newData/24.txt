Directions (Q. Nos. 1-10): Choose the correct sentences.

1. (i) My heart is too full for words.
(ii) My heart is so full that I am out of words.
(iii) My heart is so full that I cannot speak any words.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (B) i and iii (Both are grammatically correct ways to express the sentiment. Sentence (i) is a classic 'too...to' construction, and (iii) is a correct 'so...that' structure. Sentence (ii) uses the non-standard phrase "I am out of words" in this context.)

2. (i) The fact is too evident to require proof.
(ii) The fact is so evident that it does not require any proof.
(iii) The fact is too full of evidence to prove it.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (A) i and ii (Sentence (i) uses the correct 'too...to' construction. Sentence (ii) uses the correct 'so...that' construction. Sentence (iii) is awkwardly phrased and incorrect.)

3. (i) My bag is twice as big as yours.
(ii) My bag is double the size of yours.
(iii) My bag is two times heavier than yours.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (A) i and ii (Sentences (i) and (ii) are standard and correct ways to express a comparison of size. Sentence (iii) compares weight, not size, and uses the slightly less preferred "two times" instead of "twice.") **Note: The question on the sheet is presented as a comparison of size in (i) and (ii) and weight in (iii), but typically, in these English tests, (i) and (ii) are both considered correct.)**

4. (i) I finished to eat.
(ii) I have finished eating.
(iii) I am done eating.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (C) ii and iii (The verb "finish" is followed by a gerund, making (ii) correct. Sentence (iii) is a colloquial but widely accepted and correct modern phrasing. Sentence (i) is incorrect, as "finished" should be followed by a gerund ("eating"), not an infinitive ("to eat").)

5. (i) I have read the Shakespeare's King Lear.
(ii) I have read Shakespeare's King Lear.
(iii) I have completed reading Shakespeare's King Lear.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (C) ii and iii (Sentence (ii) is correct; we don't use 'the' before a possessive noun + title (Shakespeare's King Lear). Sentence (iii) is also correct, using an alternative phrasing. Sentence (i) is incorrect due to the use of 'the' before 'Shakespeare's'.)

6. (i) The Principal as well as the staff are going to Mumbai.
(ii) The Principal as well as the staff is going to Mumbai.
(iii) The Principal and the staff are going to Mumbai.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (C) ii and iii (When subjects are joined by 'as well as', the verb agrees with the first subject, **The Principal (singular)**, making (ii) correct. When subjects are joined by 'and', the verb is plural, making (iii) correct. Sentence (i) is incorrect because the verb agrees with the staff (plural) instead of the Principal (singular).)

7. (i) The reason of my silence is due to my illness.
(ii) My silence is due to my illness.
(iii) The reason of my silence is illness.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (C) ii and iii (Sentence (i) contains the redundant phrase "The reason...is due to." The phrase 'due to' already implies a reason. Sentence (ii) and (iii) correct this redundancy by using either 'due to' without 'reason' or 'is' without 'due to'.)

8. (i) I have come to a conclusion.
(ii) I have come to a final conclusion.
(iii) I have come to a final decision.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (B) i and iii (Sentence (i) is correct. Sentence (ii) is technically redundant as a **conclusion** is typically the final part of a process. However, **final decision** in (iii) is perfectly acceptable. Therefore, (i) and (iii) are the strongest answers.)

9. (i) The Headmaster and Secretary consented to the request.
(ii) The Headmaster and the Secretary gave his consent.
(iii) The Headmaster and the Secretary gave their consent.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (B) i and iii (Sentence (i) implies one person (The Headmaster and Secretary), using a singular verb ('consented' is neutral but 'the' only appears once). Sentence (iii) correctly implies two separate people (The Headmaster and The Secretary) and uses the plural pronoun/determiner 'their'. Sentence (ii) implies two people but uses the singular 'his' which is incorrect.)

10. (i) A little spark kindles great fire.
(ii) A little spark kindles a great fire.
(iii) From a little spark may burst a mighty flame.
(A) i and ii
(B) i and iii
(C) ii and iii
(D) i, ii and iii
Answer: (C) ii and iii (Sentence (i) is missing the article 'a' before 'great fire'. Sentences (ii) and (iii) are both grammatically correct and meaningful statements.)

PASSAGE:
A painter of eminence was once resolved to finish a piece which should please the world. When, therefore, he had drawn a picture in which his utmost skill was exhausted, it was exposed in the public marketplace, with directions at the bottom for every spectator to mark with a brush, which lay nearby, every limb and feature which seemed erroneous. The spectators came, and in general applauded; but each willing to show his talent at criticism, marked whatever he thought proper. At evening, when the painter came, he was mortified to find the whole picture one universal blot-not a single stroke that was not stigmatised with marks of disapprobation. Not satisfied with this trial, the next day he resolved to try them in a different manner, and exposing his picture as before, desired that every spectator would mark those beauties he approved or admired. The people complied, and the artist returning, found his picture replete with the marks of beauty; every stroke that had been yesterday condemned, now received the character of approbation. "Well", cries the painter, "I now find that the best way to please one half of the world is not to mind what the other half says; since what are faults in the eyes of these, shall be by those regarded as beauties".
