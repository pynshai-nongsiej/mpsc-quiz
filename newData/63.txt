Passage:
Mountaineering is an awfully risky venture in the case of those ambitious souls who are dreaming of conquering such majestic peaks such as Annapurna and Everest and who wish to be ranked among the world's greatest climbers.
Dozens of adventurers belonging to different nations with their hearts burning with a passion to conquer the highest peak in the world perished in the immortal snows of the Himalayas, after painfully inching their way to heights which were in close proximity to the summit.
