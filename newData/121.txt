(Marks: 150)

Directions: (Q. Nos. 1-15), Choose the correct options to fill in the gaps.

1. Mary is hanging ____ the central library waiting for her friend.
(A) in
(B) at
(C) around
(D) round
Correct Answer: (C) around
*Note: 'At' (B) is also plausible for a specific location, but 'hanging around' (C) is a common phrase meaning waiting or loitering.*

2. Hard work is indispensable ____ success.
(A) for
(B) in
(C) at
(D) to
Correct Answer: (D) to
*Note: The correct prepositional phrase is 'indispensable to'.*

3. Have you begun ____ to key the annual report?
(A) in
(B) on
(C) to
(D) at
Correct Answer: (B) on
*Note: 'Key on' or 'key in' are both possible, but 'to key on' isn't standard. Assuming the intention is to key the data, 'to key in' would be ideal, which is not an option. However, if the full phrase is 'begun to key on the annual report', meaning to focus or start work on it (though an unusual phrasing), (B) is the closest available option for a phrasal verb. Given the context of a gap fill for keying a report, 'to key in' is the most common verb. Since 'in' (A) is the only other preposition given as an option with 'to key' being the verb, and 'key in' means to enter data, (A) **in** is a plausible intended answer if the missing word is 'in' (key in the annual report).*
*Revisiting the structure: Have you begun [verb phrase/noun phrase] the annual report? The phrase is "to key [gap] the annual report". 'Key in' means to input data. Given the options, 'in' (A) is the best fit for 'key in'. The 'to key' suggests an infinitive phrase, so the original sentence structure is likely: Have you begun **to key in** the annual report? Therefore, the best answer is (A) in.*

(A) in
(B) over
(C) for
(D) with

6. He refused to partake ____ the feast.
(A) in
(B) of
(C) at
(D) with
Correct Answer: (B) of
*Note: 'Partake of' is the formal/traditional phrase meaning to eat or drink a portion of something (like a feast). 'Partake in' means to take part in an activity, which is also possible here, but 'partake of' is stronger for food/drink.*

12. The cat ran ____ the wall.
(A) up
(B) along
(C) across
(D) towards
Correct Answer: (A) up
*Note: The cat can run 'up' or 'along' a wall. 'Up' is a common action for a cat. 'Along' is also possible, but 'up' suggests climbing, which is a very characteristic cat action, making it a strong choice.*

Directions: (Q. Nos. 26-35), Choose the correct sentences.

26. (i) They were impressed by his performance.
(ii) They were impressed with his performance.
(iii) They were impressed over his performance.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (A) (i) and (ii)
*Note: Both 'impressed by' and 'impressed with' are correct. 'Impressed over' is not standard.*

27. (i) The purse is lying on the table.
(ii) The purse is lying at the table.
(iii) The purse is lying in the table.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (i)
*Note: The purse is **on** the table. 'At the table' is incorrect for position (usually for a person sitting there). 'In the table' would mean inside a drawer. Since only single correct options are not listed in (A)-(D), and (A) is the closest, let's assume this is a standard test format where the best fit must be chosen. The best fit is (i). Since (i) is part of (A) and (B), and (i) is correct, and (ii) and (iii) are clearly wrong, we must choose the option with the most correct sentences. Since (i) is the only truly correct one, and the option set doesn't reflect that, there might be an error in the question's provided options. However, in multiple correct sentence questions, usually the most commonly accepted sentences are grouped. Given the choices, **(A) (i) and (ii)** is the only available option including the correct sentence (i) and the next most plausible (though often incorrect) (ii) - which suggests the question might accept (ii) for being near the table. The safest interpretation for a correct English sentence is (i). If forced to choose from (A)-(D), and assuming the test expects more than one answer, (A) is the likely intended key if the difference between on and at is ignored.*
*Revisiting: **(i) The purse is lying on the table** is the most clearly correct. (ii) The purse is lying at the table can sometimes be used to mean near the table. (iii) is wrong. Assuming (i) is the intended correct answer, and given the options: (i) only is not an option. Let's stick with the most correct sentence which is (i), and if an option must be chosen, (A) or (B) is the intended key. I will select the most correct sentence (i) which is found in **(A) and (B)**. Given the context of a multiple choice exam, I will state **(i)** is correct, and choose **(A) (i) and (ii)** as the most likely intended key, assuming the test designer allowed a loose interpretation of 'at the table'.*

28. (i) The man whom I marry must be able to make a decent omelette.
(ii) The man that I marry must be able to make a decent omelette.
(iii) The man who I marry must be able to make a decent omelette.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (A) (i) and (ii)
*Note: (i) uses **whom** correctly as the object of 'marry'. (ii) uses **that**, which is correct for restrictive clauses. (iii) uses **who** as the object, which is technically incorrect (should be 'whom') but is common in colloquial speech. In formal English, only (i) and (ii) are strictly correct.*

29. (i) They travelled toward the jungle.
(ii) They travelled into the jungle.
(iii) They travelled across the jungle.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (D) (i), (ii) and (iii)

31. (i) Everyone in the house heard me singing in the shower.
(ii) Everyone in the house heard mine singing in the shower.
(iii) Everyone in the house heard my singing in the shower.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (B) (i) and (iii)
*Note: (i) uses the object pronoun **me** before the present participle (singing) and is common. (iii) uses the possessive adjective **my** before the gerund (singing) and is considered more formal/correct. (ii) uses the possessive pronoun **mine** before the gerund, which is incorrect.*

32. (i) Every student was told to go to their advisor.
(ii) Every student was told to go to his or her advisor.
(iii) The students were told to go to their advisors.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (C) (ii) and (iii)
*Note: (ii) uses the singular pronoun 'his or her' correctly with the singular antecedent 'Every student'. (iii) is correct as it uses the plural antecedent 'The students' with the plural pronoun 'their'. (i) uses the plural 'their' with the singular 'Every student' which is non-standard in formal grammar.*

33. (i) When he lost my book I became very angry.
(ii) When he lost my book I got very angry.
(iii) When he lost my book I felt very angry.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
*Note: All three are grammatically correct ways to express the speaker's emotional state: 'became' (more formal), 'got' (more colloquial), 'felt' (emphasizes the internal sensation).*

34. (i) The book will be launched next week.
(ii) In the following week, they launched the book.
(iii) In the next week, they launched the book.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (A) (i)
*Note: (i) is correct. (ii) is grammatically acceptable but usually 'the following week' is used after a specific point in the past. (iii) 'In the next week' is not standard English for a past action. Since (i) is clearly correct, and (ii) and (iii) are awkward or incorrect, and only (i) is definitely right, I must choose the option which includes the correct sentence. Based on the options (A)-(D), this is a common issue in this question type. I will state (i) is the best. If forced to choose, **(A) (i) and (ii)** is the most likely intended key, assuming (ii) is considered correct in context.*
*Revisiting: Only (i) is correct. Since (i) is an option in (A) and (B), and (ii) is awkward but not definitively wrong (it can follow a statement in the past), and (iii) is wrong, **(A) (i) and (ii)** is the most plausible intended grouping.*

35. (i) The daughter praised only her brother.
(ii) The daughter only praised her brother.
(iii) The daughter praised her only brother.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Correct Answer: (D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
*Note: All three are grammatically correct but have different meanings. (i) She praised no one but her brother. (ii) The only action she did was praise her brother. (iii) She has one brother, and she praised him.*
