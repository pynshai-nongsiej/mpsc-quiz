Directions (Q. Nos. 41-45) Read the passage carefully and fill in the blanks with suitable words.
People act under the urge of habit, authority, trial and error or through following some plan of 41. The most intelligent 42 to any personal problem is the determination of a plan which shows how one's desired objectives are to be attained. Once a person has perfected his plan, the next logical 43 is to put it into action.

Directions (Q. Nos. 46-50): Some parts of the sentences have errors and some have none. Find out which part of a sentence has an error and mark the corresponding letter (A), (B), (C). If there is no error mark (D) as the answer.

46. We are / looking forward to / achieved great success this year / No error
(A)
(B)
(C) [Answer - Error in (C). 'looking forward to' is a phrase followed by a gerund (V-ing), so it should be 'achieving'.]
(D)

47. There is a / violent storm / in the region last night / No error
(A)
(B)
(C) [Answer - Error in (A). The time marker 'last night' requires the past tense, so 'There was' should be used instead of 'There is'.]
(D)

48. You should / apologized to Sam / for your mistakes / No error
(A)
(B) [Answer - Error in (B). The modal verb 'should' must be followed by the base form of the verb (V1), so it should be 'apologize'.]
(C)
(D)

49. Remember to / turn off the lights / before you left home / No error
(A)
(B)
(C) [Answer - Error in (C). The main clause is in the present tense ('Remember'), and the action of leaving home is general/habitual advice, so the verb in the dependent clause should be in the present tense: 'before you leave home'.]
(D)

50. You must try / not run away / from your fears / No error
(A)
(B) [Answer - Error in (B). The structure after 'try' in this context is 'to + V1', so it should be 'not to run away' or 'not to run'.]

(D)
