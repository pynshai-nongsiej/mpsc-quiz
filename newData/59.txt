D. Comprehension:

Directions: Read the following passage and answer the questions given below it:

Passage:
What is it that makes life worthwhile? Is it material wealth, worldly treasures, material goods, assets, property, riches or is it a healthy heart blessed with love and devotion? The choice is ours to make and the decision is ours to take. With great precision has God showered upon us rationality that we must use judiciously! Alas, mankind deviates! Man succumbs to ambition, pride, avarice, lust and all the evils on earth. Where will this take us then? If our path is one that takes us away from the abode of God then we are living in pandemonium. If our path is the ways shown by God, life on earth will be lived in ecstasy. The choice is just ours!
