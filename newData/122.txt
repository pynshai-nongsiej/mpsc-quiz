Directions (Q. Nos. 36-40): In these questions, some of the sentences have errors and some have none. Find out which part of the sentence, i.e., (A), (B) or (C) has an error and select that part as an answer. If there is no error, then (D) is the answer.

36. (A) I will / (B) inform them / (C) this / (D) No error
Error: (C) this. The correct phrasing should be "inform them **of** this" or "inform them **about** this".
Answer: (C)

37. (A) He walked / (B) ten miles / (C) by foot / (D) No error
Error: (C) by foot. The correct preposition is "on foot".
Answer: (C)

38. (A) The railway / (B) will compensate us / (C) for the loss / (D) No error
Answer: (D) No error (The sentence is grammatically correct.)

39. (A) We went / (B) to mall / (C) last Saturday / (D) No error
Error: (B) to mall. It should be "to **the** mall" or "to **a** mall".
Answer: (B)

40. (A) Nina / (B) new circle of friends / (C) is throwing her a party / (D) No error
Error: (B) new circle of friends. The sentence is incomplete/misstructured. It's unclear if 'Nina's new circle of friends' is the subject or if 'Nina' is the subject and 'new circle of friends' is part of an error. Assuming the subject is meant to be the collective, it should be "Nina's new circle of friends is throwing her a party" which would make (A) and (B) combined the subject, or if 'Nina' is the subject, the sentence does not make sense. Given the structure, the phrase 'new circle of friends' as a separate part (B) is likely the source of error due to missing a possessive or a verb phrase relating it to Nina. However, as an expression, it is most likely a typing error and the intended sentence was "Nina's new circle of friends is throwing her a party." or possibly 'Nina has a new circle of friends' followed by another clause. Based on the given options, if we must choose a segment, (C) 'is throwing her a party' requires a singular subject like 'Nina' or 'Nina's circle of friends'. If (A) 'Nina' is the subject, (B) is ungrammatical. The question seems flawed, but in a test context, the error is the disjointed nature of the phrase.
*Common Error pattern*: A phrase is used as a subject/object without necessary connecting words/possessives.
Answer: (B) (The phrase is incomplete; likely should be a possessive 'Nina's new circle of friends')
