[Passage]
Motor vehicles run on either petrol or diesel, both of which are produced by refining petroleum, the thick, dark oil taken out from the depths of the earth. Petroleum is called a fossil fuel as it comes from fossils-the remains of animals and plants which lived on the earth millions of years ago and lie buried deep inside the earth. The store of fossil fuels (mainly petroleum and coal) inside the earth is limited, since no more of these fuels is being produced now. Once the store is used up, we will not have any more petrol or diesel for our aeroplanes, cars, trucks and buses. Fossil fuel are therefore called non-renewable sources of energy. As the store of fossil fuels is being used up very fast, scientists have been looking for alternative sources of energy. Fortunately, they have been able to produce fuel for diesel and petrol engines from plant sources. Scientists have learnt to convert the oil extracted from the seeds of soya beans into a liquid fuel which has been given the name 'bio-diesel'. Bio-diesel is also extracted from groundnuts, rape-seed oil and oil from a plant called jatropha. Unlike petroleum, fuel extracted from plants is a renewable source of energy. Once a plant has been harvested, another plant can grow in its place. Plants get their energy mainly from the sun, which is an unending source of energy. It has been found that bio-diesel produces much less pollution than the fuels which are now being used in engines. It is generally mixed with diesel, in the ratio 1:4, but engines can be run on pure bio-diesel.
