Section-I

Directions (Q. Nos. 1-5): Read the following passage and answer the questions given below following the instruction.

Passage:
Dad had a favourite carpet snake that he called Old Tom. Now Old Tom was big and had taken up residence in a large burnt-out stump near the packing shed. I could climb onto a fallen banana stool and peer into the stump while Dad reached in and fed the snake. When we unloaded the banana bunches from the jeep, field mice often scurried out, and sometimes Dad would stand close by and endeavour to stun the mice with the back of his cane knife. Triumphantly, he could then take his offering to Old Tom and watch with great satisfaction as the snake swallowed the mouse whole. After several months, Dad and Old Tom got to know each other quite well. So well, in fact, that he could tentatively stroke Old Tom, who seemed to like it. Dad proudly showed Old Tom to passing banana growers and they marvelled at the size of the snake and Dad's ability to stroke it. Dad, of course, did not miss the opportunity to remark on the number of mice Old Tom ate, which raised appropriate envy in the growers and made Dad's day.
