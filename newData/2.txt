PART-A: GENERAL ENGLISH (Marks: 100)
Each question carries 2 marks

Directions (Q. Nos. 1-10): Read the following passage and answer the questions given below, following the instructions.
[cite_start]People write and publish autobiographies and autobiographical sketches for a number of reasons[cite: 6]. [cite_start]One of these reasons is to put on record the events of a famous or influential career[cite: 7]. [cite_start]But not all autobiographies, not even the autobiographies most frequently and widely read, are by famous or extraordinary men[cite: 8]. [cite_start]Another reason is to hand on to others wisdom won through experience and hard labour[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Yet many fine autobiographies seem to have little concern to teach or to persuade[cite: 10]. [cite_start]A third reason is to distil from past experience events, persons and situations which hold a firm place in memory and to put true values on them[cite: 11]. [cite_start]In this sense, autobiography is, as Somerset Maugham has said, a 'summing-up' and its first utility is to its author himself[cite: 12]. [cite_start]Whatever, its purpose or the fame of the man who writes it, autobiography is a thing created out of the recollections of life[cite: 13]. [cite_start]It is not life itself[cite: 14]. [cite_start]Whether it may be valuable or useless depends upon whether it is well or ill-made[cite: 14]. [cite_start]Good autobiographies can be mined from inconspicuous lives[cite: 15]. [cite_start]For autobiography is the inclusive and summary form of what we call 'themes of experience'[cite: 15]. [cite_start]It may contain reminiscences, descriptions of places, of animals, of people, the identification of characteristic preferences and prejudices, and other matters as well[cite: 16, 19]. [cite_start]It has the traits of all these minor forms[cite: 19]. [cite_start]An autobiography is objectively true, but is not indiscriminately inclusive[cite: 20]. [cite_start]It presents a selection of detailed episodes with sufficient fullness to preserve their essential qualities[cite: 21].
