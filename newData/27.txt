(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Answer: (A) (i) and (ii) (Both "too... to" and "so... that... not" express the same negative result. (iii) is grammatically correct but less complete than (i) in conveying the full idea.)

2. (i) This box is so heavy that it cannot be lifted.
(ii) This box is heavy cannot be lifted.
(iii) This box is too heavy to lift.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)

4. (i) Walking always made him tired.
(ii) He feels like walking whenever he is tired.
(iii) He is always tired when he is walking.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Answer: (B) (i) and (iii) (All three are grammatically sound, but (i) and (iii) express a cause-effect relationship between walking and tiredness. (ii) expresses the opposite, which might be correct in a different context but makes the set semantically disjointed. Choosing the most coherent *pair* or *set* often favors the semantically related ones.)

5. (i) She could not attend the wedding as she was ill.
(ii) She could not attend the wedding on account of her illness.
(iii) She could not be ill to attend the wedding.
(A) (i) and (ii)
(B) (i) and (iii)
(C) (ii) and (iii)
(D) (i), (ii) and (iii)
Answer: (A) (i) and (ii) ((i) and (ii) correctly express cause and effect. (iii) is grammatically awkward and semantically incorrect; it means her non-illness was a requirement for attendance, which doesn't make sense as a parallel statement to the first two.)

Passage for Questions 6-15:
Poverty begets dependence, and I was admitted as a flatterer to a great man. At first, I was surprised that the situation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought disagreeable; there was no great trouble in listening attentively when his lordship spoke, and laughing when he looked round for applause. This even good manners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too soon that his lordship was a greater dunce than myself, and from that very moment flattery was at an end. I now rather aimed at setting him right than at receiving his absurdities with submission; to flatter those we do not know is an easy task, but to flatter our intimate acquaintances all whose foibles are in our eye, is drudgery insupportable. Every time I now opened my lips in praise, my falsehood went to my conscience; his lordship soon found me to be very unfit for service. I was, therefore, discharged.
