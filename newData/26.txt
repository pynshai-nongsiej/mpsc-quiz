22. Everyone in the room (A) / **were singing and laughing** (B) / when the teacher came in to teach. (C) / No error (D)
    **ANSWER: (B)** ('Everyone' is singular, so the verb should be singular: **'was singing and laughing'**)

23. Unless the entire nation (A) / **does not cooperate** (B) / we cannot hope to maintain law and order. (C) / No error (D)
    **ANSWER: (B)** ('Unless' is a negative conjunction, making the use of 'not' or 'does not' redundant. Correct: **'cooperates'**)

24. She had to come out of the house herself (A) / and buy some medicine as there was (B) / **no other alternative** (C) / No error (D)
    **ANSWER: (C)** ('Alternative' inherently means 'other choice,' making 'other' redundant. Correct: **'no alternative'** or 'no other choice')

25. If you are (A) / **self-confidence and optimistic** (B) / you can automatically radiate cheerfulness and a happy smile (C) / No error (D)
    **ANSWER: (B)** (A noun ('confidence') is used where an adjective is needed. Correct: **'self-confident and optimistic'**)

    **ANSWER: (A)** (The use of 'being' is incorrect or redundant because the sentence has an independent clause with its own subject 'she' in part C. The phrase should be a complete clause, e.g., **'Because the woman is an Indian citizen...'** or remove 'she' in C: 'The woman being an Indian citizen... has been allowed...')

28. There have been occasions when (A) / the entire opposition (B) / has walked out of the House. (C) / No error (D)
    **ANSWER: (D)** (No error)

    **ANSWER: (D)** (No error)

32. I have seen the girl (A) / **who you think** (B) / is the most attractive person in the world. (C) / No error (D)
    **ANSWER: (B)** (The pronoun is the object of the verb 'seen'/'is' in the main clause structure. It should be the objective case 'whom' or just 'who' if one considers the 'you think' as parenthetical, however, since the pronoun is the subject of 'is', the nominative **'who'** is technically correct, but the standard error would usually be to replace 'who' with 'whom'. Given the options, **(B)** is often marked as the error spot in this structure, but it is acceptable in modern usage. Assuming 'whom' is expected: **'whom you think'**)

33. She is one of (A) / the most intelligent girls (B) / **that has ever studied in this school.** (C) / No error (D)
    **ANSWER: (C)** (The relative pronoun 'that' refers to the plural antecedent 'girls', so the verb should be plural. Correct: **'that have ever studied in this school'**)

34. Raids were carried **in** (A) / all over the city to unearth (B) / illegal ammunition (C) / No error (D)
    **ANSWER: (A)** (The correct phrase is **'carried out'**, not 'carried in')
