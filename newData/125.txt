Passage:
Sir Walter Scott was a man who was honest to the core of his nature: and his strenuous and determined efforts to pay his debts, or rather the debts of the firm with which he had become involved, have always appeared to us one of the grandest things in biography. When his publisher and printer broke down, ruin seemed to stare him in the face. There was no want of sympathy for him in his great misfortune. His friends came forward and offered to raise money enough to help him arrange with his creditors: 'No, said he proudly, 'this right-hand shall work it all off,' 'If we lose everything else,' he wrote to a friend, we will at least keep our honour unblemished. While his health was already becoming undermined by overwork, he went on 'writing like a tiger', as he himself expressed it, until no longer able to yield a pen; and though he paid the penalty of his supreme efforts with his life; he nevertheless saved his honour and his self-respect.

Directions: (Q6-10): Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:
Passage:
Humanitarianism took many forms. It was evidenced in the widespread demand for "reform"- reform of society as preached by Rousseau, reform of economics as advocated by Adam Smith, reforms of laws as demanded by Beccaria and Bentham, reform of ethics as sponsored by Kant, reform of religion as urged by Voltaire and the deists by Wesley and the pietists. All such reform, it was contended, would make for human liberty, for human health and wealth, for human perfection. Indeed it was optimistically assumed that the study of man, his individual and social characteristics, would but prove how perfectible he is; how, if freed from the trammels of the past and reliant only on his own reason, he would create a social, political, economic, ethical, and religious paradise on earth and would create it very soon.
