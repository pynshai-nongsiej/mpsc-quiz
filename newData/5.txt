Directions (Q. Nos. 21-25): Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.

The Madras High Court on Friday granted 30 days of ordinary leave to S. Nalini, 52, a life convict in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination case. The order was passed after she argued her case in person and made a fervent plea to the judges in a choked voice that she may be allowed to step out of prison for some days to make arrangements for the marriage of her daughter, who is residing in London. Nalini had many years ago come out on short paroles of a day each to attend her brother Bhagyanathan's wedding and her father's last rites. Justices M. M. Sundresh and M. Nirmal Kumar took judicial notice that the State Cabinet itself had on September 9 last year made a recommendation to the Governor to release all seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. "If, in the view of the government, the petitioner can be allowed to lead a normal life and she would not be a hindrance to the society, the request for leave can never be objected to," they said. The judges also directed the State Government to bear the expenses of providing escort to her during the period of leave since she expressed difficulty in paying the charges. "There is no material to hold that she is a women of means. Admittedly, she and her husband are in incarceration for decades. Asking the petitioner to pay the cost would in a way take away the very order passed by us when it is impossible of compliance," they said.

21. Why was S. Nalini sentenced to lifetime imprisonment by the judiciary of the country?
(A) She murdered a lot of people during her school days and that came out in the open later
(B) She murdered her family out of mercy though her husband had left her for another woman before that
(C) She did not do anything but the court was of the view that she could do something if left to fend for herself within the society
(D) She was involved in the assassination of the former Prime Minister of India
[cite_start]**Answer: (D) She was involved in the assassination of the former Prime Minister of India** [cite: 191, 208]
[cite_start]The passage identifies her as "a life convict in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination case"[cite: 191].

22. Which among the following is correct regarding the attitude of the State Government towards the sentence of life imprisonment given to S. Nalini?
(A) The State Government has nothing to say in the whole issue since the case was dealt with by the Central Government.
(B) The State Government could not understand the fact that there was nothing wrong done by S. Nalini many years ago.
(C) The State Government is of the opinion that the sentence given to S. Nalini can be remitted at once.
(D) The State Government wants the convict to continue with the given sentence by the court for the crime committed by her.
**Answer: (C) The State Government is of the opinion that the sentence given to S. Nalini can be remitted at once.**
[cite_start]The judges took "judicial notice that the State Cabinet itself had on September 9 last year made a recommendation to the Governor to release all seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case"[cite: 194]. This shows the State Government's opinion is for remittance/release.

23. Which among the following are not correct as per the given passage?
I. This is the first time that S. Nalini has been given the permission to come out on parole.
II. S. Nalini has been granted the right to come out on parole to perform the last rites of her husband.
III. S. Nalini has no child and that is why she is not at all happy with the sentence.
(A) Both I and II
(B) Both II and III
(C) Both I and III
(D) All I, II and III
**Answer: (D) All I, II and III**
* [cite_start]I is incorrect: "Nalini had many years ago come out on short paroles of a day each to attend her brother Bhagyanathan's wedding and her father's last rites." [cite: 193]
* [cite_start]II is incorrect: She was granted leave "to make arrangements for the marriage of her daughter"[cite: 192], not for her husband's last rites.
* [cite_start]III is incorrect: She requested leave for the marriage of "her daughter, who is residing in London"[cite: 192].

24. Which among the following is/are correct regarding the observations of the Madras High Court regarding S. Nalini?
I. S. Nalini is a very rich woman and that is why no monetary support is required to be given to her.
II. S. Nalini is a dreaded criminal and that is why she should be put behind the bars for life with no chance at any kind of reformation.
III. S. Nalini has intentionally jeopardized her relationship with her husband and that is why she should be punished for that.
(A) Both I and II
(B) Both II and III
(C) Both I and III
(D) None of I, II and III
**Answer: (D) None of I, II and III**
[cite_start]The court observed, "There is no material to hold that she is a women of means" [cite: 197][cite_start], which contradicts I[cite: 229]. [cite_start]The passage focuses on granting leave and the state cabinet's recommendation for release [cite: 191, 194][cite_start], contradicting the idea of her being a "dreaded criminal" with "no chance at any kind of reformation" (II)[cite: 230]. [cite_start]Statement III [cite: 231] is not mentioned in the passage.

25. Which among the following would be similar in meaning to the word fervent as used in the passage?
(A) Ardent
(B) Vehement
(C) Feeling
(D) Pragmatic
**Answer: (A) Ardent**
*Fervent* means having or displaying a passionate intensity. *Ardent* means enthusiastic or passionate. *Vehement* is often associated with intense, sometimes angry, emotion, while *ardent* is a closer synonym for the type of passionate plea described.

The following sentence contrasts physical size with mental/intellectual development, suggesting that the growth of mind is *never* in proportion to the growth of the body.

33. (A) earn
(B) attain
(C) keep
(D) grow
**Answer: (B) attain**
The context is a man who achieves or reaches the physical size of a giant: "The man **attain** may physically the state of a giant..." (Note: There is a likely typo in the original question's sentence structure, but *attain* fits best with *state*).

Directions (Q. Nos. 36-40): In the following questions, a sentence is given. Find out which part of the sentence has an error and choose the option corresponding to it. If the sentence is free from error, choose 'No error'.

36. He dare not to go there.
(A) He dare
(B) not to
(C) go there
(D) No error
**Answer: (B) not to**
The verb *dare* used as a modal auxiliary (followed by *not*) does not take *to* before the main verb (*go*). The correct sentence is "He dare not go there."

37. He was elected as Chairman of the Committee.
(A) He was elected
(B) as Chairman
(C) of the Committee
(D) No error
**Answer: (B) as Chairman**
Verbs like *elect*, *appoint*, *make*, etc., do not require the use of *as* before the title in the passive voice. The correct sentence is "He was elected Chairman of the Committee."

38. Many of the young people studying abroad agreed that returning home was always an attractive option.
(A) Many of the young people studying abroad
(B) agreed that returning home was
(C) always an attractive option
(D) No error
**Answer: (D) No error**
The sentence is grammatically correct.

39. Whoever assumes his confession true is foolish.
(A) Whoever assumes
(B) his confession true
(C) is foolish
(D) No error
**Answer: (B) his confession true**
The verb *assumes* needs a complementary structure. The adjective *true* should be replaced by the noun *to be true* or the phrase should be "Whoever assumes his confession **is** true..." The error lies in the construction "his confession true." The most idiomatic correction would be "Whoever assumes his confession **to be** true is foolish."

40. She has been complaining about headache from morning.
(A) She has been
(B) complaining about headache
(C) from morning
(D) No error
**Answer: (C) from morning**
The present perfect continuous tense (*has been complaining*) requires *since* (for a point in time) or *for* (for a duration) to indicate the starting point or length of time. *From* is incorrect in this context; it should be "**since** morning."

(A) Sarita told me that I would do it then or never.
